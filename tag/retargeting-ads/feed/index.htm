										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember how that eye-catching Facebook ad grabbed your attention? The timing was perfect, the product was exactly what you were looking for, and the price was right. You clicked on the ad, thinking you would buy it immediately, but the checkout process took longer than expected, and you didn’t have time to finish. Later that day you went back to proceed with the purchase, but your item was gone, and of course, you couldn’t find the product page. Your FOMO (fear of missing out) was real. If only you could see that same ad again to take you back.</p>
<p>This type of buyer journey happens more often than you think. To prevent your business from missing out on the sales from these customers, include Facebook Retargeting Ads as a part of your Advantage+ catalog campaigns (formerly Dynamic Product Ads).</p>
<p><strong>Retargeting reduces cart abandonment by 6.5%. (MotoCMS)</strong></p>
<p>Retargeting ads work by reminding customers about products they&#8217;ve previously visited or bought on your website, mobile app, Marketplace, or Facebook/Instagram Shop. This popular marketing tactic helps retailers <strong>increase the performance of shopping campaigns on Facebook</strong>.<br />
Find out more about the benefits of Facebook retargeting ads and how to get more engagement from personalized and up-to-date product catalog campaigns.</p>

<h2>Retargeting Platforms and Tools for Running Facebook Retargeting Ads</h2>
<p>If you’re an eCommerce retailer looking to scale your retargeting campaigns, there are a variety of platforms that can help you streamline your advertising.<br />

</ul>
<h2>Improve your Facebook Retargeting Ads and Ad Performance Over Time</h2>
<p>The devil is in the details when it comes to increasing the performance of your Facebook Retargeting ads. If your previous campaign fell short of your marketing goals, get to the root of the problem to improve your ROI for next time.</p>
<p><b>To help you gain a better understanding of how to interpret your results, ask yourself these three questions</b></p>
<ol>
<li>How did this campaign compare to previous campaigns?
<ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Were there different products?</li>
<li>Was the time of year the same?</li>
<li>Were there similar promotions?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did the ads have all of the correct product information displayed in an enticing format to encourage a purchase?</li>
<li>Did you have enough personalized audience data to retarget in a way that would achieve your goal, like converting users who abandoned their cart?</li>
</ol>
<p><b>A lesser-known but extremely important question involves the quality and structure of the product data that impact the effectiveness of your ads.</b></p>
<p>When it comes to advertising your catalog in different countries with <a href="https://Suvae.org/set-up-multiple-facebook-product-catalogs-with-product-feeds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple catalogs</a>, product information like price, sale price, currency, and language may be different in each country. Take these factors into consideration to develop a <a href="https://Suvae.org/create-a-multi-country-product-feed-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-country and multi-currency feed</a> strategy based on the campaign’s target country.</p>
<p>Other factors that affect ad performance are the keywords and placement of product differentiators in areas like your product title and description. Optimizing these parts of your product feed allows you to position your products in the best possible way to your audience.</p>
<p>This is where Suvae.org’s technology can help. The platform optimizes the product data used in your Facebook catalog ads. Having better-optimized product data leads to better results from your retargeting ads.</p>
