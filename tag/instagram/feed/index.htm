										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a consumer “likes” a post you’ve published on social media, it could be an indication they’re interested in the fashion, accessories or other products you’re promoting. A positive comment could suggest affinity with your brand’s style. The ideal response to any social media post, however, is when the consumer clicks on a link or “buy” button that leads to an actual purchase.</p>
<p>As social platforms make it increasingly easier to manage financial transactions directly through their services, retailers are realizing they can use them for far more than marketing activities. In fact, social commerce represents a huge opportunity to convert and grow revenue.</p>
<p>To understand how to sell using social commerce, read on.</p>
<h2>What is Social Shopping or Social Commerce?</h2>
<p>For everyday consumers, social media continues to be a place they come to share photos and videos with their family and friends. While brands initially established their own accounts to advertise products and direct them back to their own eCommerce stores, social commerce means they are now using these platforms to provide a seamless digital shopping experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/07/18/2915426/0/en/The-8-5-Trillion-Global-Market-for-Social-Commerce-2030-Security-Privacy-Concerns-and-Legal-Issues-are-the-Biggest-Challenge-for-Market-Players.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social commerce sales are forecast to reach $8.5 trillion globally by 2030</a>. Clothing is expected to be the fastest-growing category in this space, representing<a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2022/shopping-on-social-media-platforms-expected-to-reach-1-2-trillion-globally-by-2025-new-accenture-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 18% of social commerce sales by 2025</a>. In the U.S. alone,<a href="https://www.abc4.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/728564235/simplicitydx-publishes-2024-state-of-social-commerce-impact-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 77% pursue social shopping at least once per week</a>.</p>
<p>The first step in developing a shoppable storefront on social media is to ensure you can<a href="https://Suvae.org/product-feed-management/social-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> easily connect your product catalog to social platforms</a> where your customers are browsing. Product feed management makes this far easier to accomplish and scalable across multiple social services.</p>
<p>At the same time, you should become familiar with the unique requirements and social shopping opportunities each platform offers.</p>
<h2>Top Social Commerce Platforms</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11566" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-02.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-02.jpg 700w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-02-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Approaching social media as a brand is a lot different than what you might have experienced as a consumer. You’re not just sharing content broadly to the world but taking advantage of channels within each service that can maximize your social commerce sales.</p>
<p>These are some best practices specific to the most popular platforms.</p>
<h3>Mastering Facebook Social Commerce</h3>
<p>The volume of<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/insights/social-commerce-brand-trends-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> consumers shopping on Facebook is expected to reach more than 64.6 million</a> in 2024, making it the largest social commerce platform. To reach that audience:</p>
<h4>Leverage Facebook Shops</h4>
<p>Facebook offers a shoppable storefront where retailers can create collections of their products based on a theme, such as seasonable apparel.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2343035149322466?id=1077620002609475" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Setting up a Facebook Shop</a> allows you to display your brand’s name, logo, ratings and other details in addition to products. It’s also easy for users to discover Facebook Shops through their fields or via a dedicated tab and follow it and make purchases.</p>
<h4>Use Dynamic Ads</h4>
<p>No one has time to make thousands of individual ads to promote every product in their catalog.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/one-sheeters/dynamic-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook’s Dynamic Ads</a> address this by allowing you to promote your entire catalog while also delivering relevant product recommendations to Facebook users based on their interests.</p>
<h4>Engage with Facebook Live</h4>
<p>Retailers have often used the power of a live in-store event to attract shoppers and give them a closeup look at their featured products.<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+live&#038;sca_esv=2a19a3414e05e997&#038;rlz=1C1ONGR_enCA1009CA1009&#038;sxsrf=ADLYWILQUPYLFJsCYdHTWNbSaCLWUA73_A%3A1721660929121&#038;ei=AXaeZtyLB7rgp84PoryNqAw&#038;ved=0ahUKEwickOrg9rqHAxU68MkDHSJeA8UQ4dUDCA8&#038;uact=5&#038;oq=facebook+live&#038;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDWZhY2Vib29rIGxpdmUyChAjGIAEGCcYigUyChAjGIAEGCcYigUyDhAAGIAEGJECGLEDGIoFMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABEjWClDjA1jVBnACeACQAQCYAV-gAYoCqgEBM7gBA8gBAPgBAZgCBKACxgHCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHwgINEAAYgAQYsAMYQxiKBZgDAOIDBRIBMSBAiAYBkAYKkgcBNKAH4BY&#038;sclient=gws-wiz-serp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook Live</a> offers a way to do the exact same thing but on a global scale. Showcase items with live models, answer questions from potential buyers and offer the kind of authentic connection that consumers crave.</p>
<h4>Optimize for Mobile</h4>
<p>It may have started in the days when desktops were still the dominant device for browsing the web, but most consumers are probably scrolling the Facebook app on their smartphone. Make sure you don’t disappoint them by ensuring you’re offering fast page loads and adjusting text and images to display on smaller screens.</p>
<p><b>Feed integration:</b> Facebook Shops and Dynamic Ads need to properly convey every important detail about the items you’re selling. This includes not only names but pricing, images, descriptions, SKUs and availability statuses. Automating Facebook product feed management will render everything consumers need to know in the right format, every time.</p>
<h3>Instagram Social Shopping: Everything You Need to Know</h3>
<p>Whether gazing at photos or watching Reels, Instagram also commands a sizable social shopping audience, with<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/social-media-top-channel-shoppers-worldwide-discover-buy-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 46.8 million expected to make purchases there in 2024</a>. Instagram is also well established as a home for highly engaging fashion and lifestyle content, making it an ideal digital destination for many eCommerce brands. There are plenty of ways to attract customers:</p>
<h4>Utilize Instagram Shopping</h4>
<p>There’s no shorter path to purchase than “see it, buy it,” which is exactly what<a href="https://business.instagram.com/shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Instagram Shopping</a> was designed to offer U.S. retailers. Posts will include one-click access to view collections, detailed product pages or simply buy directly through the app. You’ll need to set up a business profile on Instagram and comply with Instagram’s merchant agreement to get approved. You’ll then be able to tag up to 20 products and shops in a photo feed post, 10 photos and videos in a carousel post.</p>
<h4>Create Shoppable Posts</h4>
<p>Consumers have come to recognize the little shopping bag icon that identifies Shoppable Posts on Instagram, which allow them to streamline the process of ordering a product they want. Bear in mind that they are likely looking at multiple brands on Instagram at any given moment, and Shoppable Posts let them stay in the app even as they make purchases. You can enhance your Shoppable Posts by not only creating enticing images, but adding important context such as sizing, fit or styling.</p>
<h4>Leverage Influencers</h4>
<p>Instagram is a great example of a platform where users are building up audiences that dwarf that of many brands. These creators are also called influencers because consumers pay close attention to products they recommend and endorse. Partnering with influencers can help draw more attention to your Shoppable Posts and other Instagram content to boost your social commerce sales.</p>
<h4>Use Instagram Stories</h4>
<p>Instagram may have originally been focused on photography, but today users can create Stories that blend images, video, text and special effects. Brands can do the same thing, illustrating how their products could be worn or used in a particular context or locale. Instagram Stories are also ideal for conveying the kind of key messages that were once reserved for expensive TV spots, while also offering a fast and easy way to take the next step and buy items.</p>
<p><b>Feed Integration: </b>Developing a shoppable storefront on Instagram requires adding details to its Commerce Manager platform. This includes either connecting your existing catalog or creating a new one. That could be a laborious and error-prone job without a product feed management solution that instantly transmits the right data and accelerates Instagram’s review process.</p>
<h3>Social Shopping on Pinterest: Your Secret Weapon</h3>
<p>Whether you’re decorating your home or creating a board full of outfit ideas, Pinterest is the ultimate way to curate ideas and products that speak to your individual style. No wonder<a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/pinterest-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 85% of Pinterest users have made a purchase based on a pin</a>. Make sure your brand is among those benefiting:</p>
<h4>Optimize Product Pins</h4>
<p><a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en-ca/blog/optimize-your-product-feed-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Every pin you promote as a brand should tell a story</a>. This not only includes visual storytelling with images but metadata such as the keywords you use to describe them. Also make sure to tag across multiple categories where appropriate to maximize discoverability and form product groups with the same care you’d put complementary products on a table in a physical store.</p>
<h4>Use Rich Pins</h4>
<p>Pinterest recognizes that product information should never stay static. That’s why it offers<a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/rich-pins" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Rich Pins</a>, which automatically sync data from your website. This means you can have the latest ingredients in a Recipe Rich Pin, or updated pricing and availability for Product Rich Pins.</p>
<h4>Create Themed Boards</h4>
<p>Pinterest boards don’t have to be random assortments of products. Much like an in-store experience, you’ll provide a better experience for customers by organizing pins based on broader similarities, customer interests and needs. A good example might be a vacation-themed board that includes everything you should buy before setting off on your next getaway.</p>
<h4>Engage with Visual Search</h4>
<p>Shopping inspiration can come from anywhere, but the hard work comes when you need to track down something that appeals to you. Visual search technologies ease that journey by allowing consumers to simply point at an item and look it up online.<a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/article/pinterest-lens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Pinterest Lens</a>, for instance, can drive more consumers to your pins when you have multiple optimized images of your products with accurate data.</p>
<p><b>Feed Integration:</b> Pinterest allows brands to add 50 different data sources, but doing so manually requires many steps, and Pinterest requires data be updated every seven days. This could become a full-time job without an automated feed management solution that can handle this on a scheduled basis.</p>
<h3>TikTok Social Commerce: Go Viral with Your Sales</h3>
<p>Some come for the singing and dancing. Some come for the memes. There are also plenty of people who visit TikTok for both types of content – in addition to hunting for their next luxury item.<a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/tiktok-shop-statistics/#:~:text=More%20than%2055%20million%20TikTok,social%20shoppers%20reaching%2039.5%20million." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> More than 55 million U.S. consumers shopped on TikTok</a> in 2023, either through links in the app or directly on the platform. Now is the time to meet your customers here as well. Here’s how:</p>
<h4>Create Engaging Content</h4>
<p>TikTok first became known for the extreme brevity of its content, as well as a sense of humor that tended to skew towards younger consumers. As the platform grows, its audience will inevitably become more diverse, but the same lighthearted and fun-loving spirit remains. Instead of a hard product pitch, try to develop clips that put what you sell into an unconventional environment, or answer some of the funniest questions you’ve ever been asked by existing customers. If you know some of your loyal customers well, see if they’ll be part of clips that are part of viral trends, such as posts with the #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt hashtag.</p>
<h4>Leverage TikTok Shopping</h4>
<p><a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-tiktok-shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Shop</a> incorporates many of the features of other social shopping platforms, including the ability to be featured on a Shop tab, in-feed and live shopping as well as product showcases. Of course you’ll have to adhere to TikTok’s community guidelines and TikTok Shop policies to set up this kind of shoppable storefront after signing up to its seller program.</p>
<h4>Partner with Creators</h4>
<p>Like Instagram, TikTok is filled with creators who have mastered the art of short-form video. Involve them anywhere from launch campaigns and unboxing opportunities to clips that let them explain to their followers why your products are essential items.</p>
<h4>Use Hashtag Challenges</h4>
<p>TikTok is perhaps the most “gamified” social media platform where<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/branded-hashtag-challenge-harness-the-power-of-participation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> brands can challenge users</a> to compete with one another to create the best content. Examples here could include clips that demonstrate the best use of your products to bring your company’s slogan to life in a new way.</p>
<p><b>Feed Integration:</b> TikTok suggest brands can create new catalogs, upload products from an online file or use a template. There’s actually another, better way: leverage the power of a proven product feed management solution to ensure every attribute is included and leave your</p>
<h2>2024&#8217;s Trends in Social Commerce</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11567 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-03.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-03.jpg 700w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-03-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Social commerce is an ever-moving target. As platforms continue to compete with each other for consumers’ attention, we’ll see them experiment with new technologies and introduce features to drive even more immersive engagement.</p>
<p>Given giants such as Meta not only own Facebook and Instagram but WhatsApp, for instance, expect to see further integration of social commerce within messaging apps that allow consumers to get their contacts’ opinions on their purchases. Evolving mobile device hardware could allow social commerce via augmented and virtual reality. Other areas, such as live shopping, are still nascent and poised for further expansion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billions of people use social networking sites like Facebook and Instagram to connect with friends &amp; family,<br />
According to Business of Apps, <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram has grown from 1 billion users in 2018 to 1.41 in 2021</a> and <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook has grown from 2.23 billion to 2.9 billion users</a> in the same period.<br />
But for a global fashion brand, does it make sense to integrate your store directly with these platforms? The answer is an absolute yes.</p>
<p>The rise of digital marketplaces, social media shopping, and eCommerce continues to drive increased demand for popular brands to make their products available through social media marketplaces.<br />
This exact reason led Facebook to create a Facebook Shop for eCommerce businesses looking to create online storefronts through Facebook and Instagram. With mobile eCommerce expected to reach a $3.56 trillion value in 2021, it’s clear why this is the focus today. Facebook Shop is free to use, allowing companies to add their products to the most popular social networks available.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive into the benefits of a Facebook Shop for your international brand,  how a Facebook Shop differs from an Instagram Shop, and examples of both in practice.</p>
<h2>Facebook Shop Benefits: The 6 Cs</h2>
<h2><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10927" style="color: #666666; font-size: 14px;" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/head-Benefits-of-Facebook2.jpg" alt="The Benefits of Facebook Shops For Global Brands &amp; Retailers" width="700" height="467" /></h2>
<p>Launching your storefront with Shops is one of the best steps you can take to boost your chance of success. Why? The platform offers several features that brands and retailers will be interested in.</p>
<h3>1. Complete Customization</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10929" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facebook-Shops-Customization.jpg" alt="The Benefits of Facebook Shops For Global Brands &amp; Retailers" width="700" height="292" /></p>
<p>You have <strong>complete control over what your storefront will look like online</strong>. Tweak the colors, graphics, typefaces, buttons, and general layout to match how you want your brand image to look.<br />
Best of all, even marketers with little design or technical experience can take advantage of the platform’s easy-to-use tools. You even get a mobile preview on the side for instant feedback.</p>
<h3>2. Collections</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10930" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facebook-Shops-Collection.jpg" alt="The Benefits of Facebook Shops For Global Brands &amp; Retailers" width="700" height="233" /></p>
<p><strong>Easily manage what products you want to show</strong> off the most. No matter how many different items you need to juggle, keep them organized through Collections, a feature for effectively cataloging your products.</p>
<p>Just head to the Shops customization page, go to “layout,” and click “add collection” to get started. Collections work best when you have a lineup of related products released together, such as a summer collection or a “back to school” sale.<br />
Collections themselves just look pretty and can catch the eyes of passing visitors with their beautiful imagery and design.</p>
<h3>3. Convenient Communication</h3>
<div style="padding-left: 22px;">
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10936" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/head-Benefits-of-Facebook4.png" alt="" width="300" height="394" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/head-Benefits-of-Facebook4.png 389w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/head-Benefits-of-Facebook4-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Facebook Shop is connected to major social networks, with <strong>access to communication tools like WhatsApp and Messenger for direct responses to customer questions and comments.</strong><br />
This real-time nature of your conversations will boost customer retention, and enhance your ability to provide personalized experiences.</p>
</div>
<h3>4. Custom Audiences</h3>
<div style="padding-left: 22px;">
<p>Just like any online storefront, advertising and how you reach the right shoppers to <strong>maximize engagement</strong> are extremely important. In a nutshell, everyone who’s ever viewed or bought products from you or otherwise showed some sort of interest gets grouped into your own Custom Audience.</p>
<p>You have a chance to re-target these people for advertising with an option to filter based on certain demographic traits like location, age, and gender.</p>
</div>
<h3>5. Compatibility with eCommerce Tools</h3>
<div style="padding-left: 22px;">
<p>To help you navigate the lucrative but also complicated world of online commerce, several third-party market integration tools are available to businesses today. Facebook is working with <strong>multiple partners to integrate your products with Facebook Shop</strong>, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://Suvae.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Suvae.org</strong></a></li>
<li>WooCommerce</li>
<li>Shopify</li>
<li>Channel Advisor</li>
<li>Feedonomics</li>
<li>And various others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Marketing and selling products on Facebook Shop is all about using the right tools and taking advantage of the <strong>massive audience</strong> you have with Facebook and Instagram.</p>
</div>
<h3>6. Collecting Insights and Analytics</h3>
<div style="padding-left: 22px;">
<p>Detailed analytics are extremely valuable to eCommerce companies, as they provide <strong>actionable insights into your sales and products</strong>. Facebook and Instagram have a built-in Insights feature within the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/713927982072352?id=1077620002609475&amp;ref=fb4b_shops_products" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commerce Manager</a>. From there, you can find data regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visitor traffic, both how much and where they are coming from</li>
<li>Demographic of your target market</li>
<li>Tagged content</li>
<li>Catalog insights</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also view <strong>statistics based on your needs,</strong> according to a date range, or by the site (either only Facebook or only Instagram).</p>
</div>
<h2>Facebook Shop vs Marketplace</h2>
<p>Facebook Shop and Facebook Marketplace are indeed distinct features provided by Facebook, and they serve different purposes with their unique functionalities.<br />
Here&#8217;s a brief comparison:</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Shop:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Facebook Shop is a feature designed for businesses and brands to set up an online storefront on their Facebook Page or Instagram profile. It allows businesses to showcase their products and services in a more organized and branded way.</li>
<li><strong>E-commerce:</strong> It enables businesses to list products, provide product details, and pricing, and link directly to their website for purchasing.</li>
<li><strong>Customization:</strong> You can customize the look and feel of your shop to align with your brand&#8217;s identity.</li>
<li><strong>Payments:</strong> Customers can make purchases through integrated payment systems, and you can manage orders within Facebook.</li>
<li><strong>Business Insights:</strong> Provides access to business insights and analytics to help track the performance of your shop.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Facebook Marketplace:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Facebook Marketplace is designed for individuals to buy and sell products locally within their community. It&#8217;s a platform for users to list items for sale or browse items for purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Local Transactions:</strong> It focuses on local transactions, and you can filter listings based on location and category.</li>
<li><strong>User-to-User Sales:</strong> Typically used for peer-to-peer sales, such as selling used items, furniture, electronics, and more.</li>
<li><strong>No E-commerce Integration:</strong> Unlike Facebook Shop, Marketplace doesn&#8217;t provide a platform for businesses to create a branded storefront or integrate e-commerce functionalities.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> Buyers and sellers can communicate through Facebook Messenger to arrange transactions and meetings.</li>

<p>Facebook Shop is more suitable for businesses and brands looking to establish an online store presence, while Facebook Marketplace is oriented toward local, person-to-person transactions. The choice between the two depends on your goals and whether you are an individual looking to buy or sell used items locally or a business looking to showcase and sell products to a broader online audience.</p>
<h2>Facebook Shop vs Instagram Shop</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 22px;">
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10932" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/head-Benefits-of-Facebook3.jpg" alt=" Facebook Shops Benefits vs. Instagram Shops Benefits" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>What are the different benefits of selling on Facebook Shop as opposed to Instagram Shops? Here are three main differences:</p>
<h3>Market Availability</h3>
<p>Facebook has a broad global presence, so it&#8217;s accessible to a wide range of markets. However, certain features and functionalities within Facebook Shop, such as payment options and integration with local shipping providers, might be more limited in some regions.</p>
<p><a style="font-size: 14px;" href="https://m.facebook.com/help/instagram/321000045119159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Shops is available in select markets</a><span style="color: #666666; font-size: 14px;">.  </span>Instagram has a large international user base, and the Shop feature is designed to cater to businesses targeting Instagram&#8217;s global audience. Like Facebook Shop, the availability of specific features and payment options in Instagram Shop can vary by region, as it depends on local regulations and partnerships.<br />
Both Facebook and Instagram checkout is only available in the United States</p>
<h3>Product Display</h3>
<p>Instagram has a unique way of organizing the product. The Shops section pulls together multiple product recommendations based on browsing history, and places them into a central location known as “Products For You”.This allows users to easily navigate, as they&#8217;re on a small touchscreen device like a mobile. Facebook doesn’t have this feature.</p>
<p>In summary, Facebook Shop offers more flexibility in terms of product organization, customization, and the use of rich media content, while Instagram Shops are designed to be highly visual and mobile-friendly, with an emphasis on product tagging in organic content.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>The setup process is slightly different between the two platforms. The main differences between setting up a Facebook Shop and an Instagram Shop are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1. Platform and Interface:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Shop:</strong> To set up a Facebook Shop, you need a Facebook Page for your business. You manage and configure your shop through Facebook&#8217;s Commerce Manager. This provides a more comprehensive set of tools and options for product management and customization.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Shop:</strong> To create an Instagram Shop, you need an Instagram Business or Creator account, and it should be linked to a Facebook Page. You set up and manage your shop directly on Instagram, and it primarily focuses on the visual presentation of your products within the Instagram app.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Catalog Creation and Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Shop:</strong> You create and manage your product catalog within Facebook&#8217;s Commerce Manager. This catalog includes detailed information about your products, pricing, availability, and customization options for categorization and organization.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Shop:</strong> You can create and manage your product catalog directly within Instagram or sync it with an existing catalog from Facebook&#8217;s Commerce Manager. Instagram&#8217;s catalog is typically more streamlined, with a focus on visuals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Payment Processing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Shop:</strong> You need to set up payment processing options through Facebook to accept payments for products in your Facebook Shop. Various payment methods like PayPal and Stripe can be integrated.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Shop:</strong> Instagram facilitates the checkout process for customers within the app. Users can make purchases without leaving Instagram, and you&#8217;ll need to set up payment options specifically through Instagram Shopping.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Customization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Shop:</strong> Facebook Shops offer more extensive customization options for your shop&#8217;s appearance. You can add banner images, create product collections, and highlight featured products. This allows for a more tailored shopping experience.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Shop:</strong> Instagram Shops have a more streamlined interface and are more focused on visual presentation. Product descriptions are typically shorter, and the emphasis is on the visual appeal of the products.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Tagging Products:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Shop:</strong> While you can set up a Facebook Shop, it doesn&#8217;t have the same product tagging feature as Instagram. However, you can integrate your Facebook Shop with your Instagram account, enabling product tagging in Instagram posts and stories.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Shop:</strong> Instagram Shops are designed for seamless product tagging. You can tag your products in Instagram posts, stories, and IGTV videos, allowing users to view product details and make purchases within the Instagram app.</li>
</ul>

This includes providing specific product details, such as product ID, title, description, availability, condition, price, currency, and link to the product&#8217;s image.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instagram’s newest eCommerce feature – Instagram Shop- makes it easier for customers to purchase products from your store.<br />
With more than  <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>2.3 billion active users </strong></a>using Instagram every month, the platform allows you to showcase your products in front of potential buyers through Instagram’s shoppable posts and stories.</p>
<p>But what exactly is an Instagram Shop? How do you set it up and how is an Instagram shop different from a Facebook shop? Let’s dive deeper and find out.</p>
<h2>What is an Instagram Shop?</h2>
<p>Instagram Shops allows businesses to create an in-app storefront to build their brand and drive product feeds. The shop can be accessed through a business’s Instagram profile, posts, or stories. Once in the storefront, your visitors can browse products, and collections and make purchases directly from your storefront thanks to <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-instagram-checkout?igb_blog_shops_launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram’s checkout</a>.</p>
<p>Instagram Shop helps streamline the process of posting posts and stories, encouraging viewers to visit your website or brick-and-mortar store.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7479" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Untitled.jpg" alt="instagram-shop-and-ecommerce-products-set-up-11" width="300" height="574" /></p>
<p>Users can use Instagram Shop to browse products based on categories, such as beauty or home decor. Later this year, Instagram promised the reveal a shop tab in the navigation bar.</p>
<h2>What’s the difference between Facebook and Instagram Shops?</h2>
<p>The difference between the two is minimal.</p>
<p>Facebook Shops allows you to create a dedicated “shop” section on your Facebook page where products can be purchased, saved, or shared by users. Shops are extremely customizable – businesses can choose which products they would like to feature, set a cover image, and accent colors that can best showcase their brand.</p>
<p>Additionally, Facebook Shops are integrated into Facebook’s apps – so you can make it available from your shop’s Instagram, and can be shared on your stories and ads. They make it easier for visitors to ask questions, as they’ll be able to message your business through WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram Direct.</p>
<h2>How to add products to your Instagram shop</h2>
<p>The opportunities to increase sales through Instagram are huge, with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/instagram/shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70% of shopping enthusiasts</a> turning to this social platform for product discovery. With a few simple steps, your shop will provide a simple, and seamless shopping experience for your customers.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Check that your business meets the requirements</h3>
<p>Before getting started you must ensure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>You’re based in a country where Instagram Shops are available.</b> <a href="https://help.instagram.com/321000045119159?ref=fbb_ig_shopping_setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is the list to confirm</a>.</li>
<li><b>Your Instagram has a business or creator profile on Instagram.</b> View these simple instructions on how to change your settings.</li>
<li><b>You’ve connected Instagram to your shop’s Facebook page</b>. This will allow you to connect your Facebook Shop’s product catalog.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Upload your product catalog</h3>
<p>There are two ways to upload your catalog:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Facebook catalog manager.</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1275400645914358?id=725943027795860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More details can be found here</a>.</li>
<li><b>eCommerce integration.</b> This integration can be done through partners such as Shopify, and Bigcommerce.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Get your Instagram Shop approved</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve ensured that your shop fulfills the requirements and your product catalog is complete, you can submit your account for approval.</p>
<ul>
<li>This can be done by going to “Settings”:</li>
<li>And then “Sign up for Instagram Shopping”</li>
<li>Follow the prompted steps and then hit “Submit”</li>
</ul>
<p>Allow for a couple of business days for your request to be approved. You can check your status by going to “Shopping” located in your “Settings”.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Turn on the shopping</h3>
<p>Yay, you’ve been approved! It’s time to turn on the shopping</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on “Settings”</li>
<li>Tap “Business” then “Shopping”</li>
<li>Select the product catalog you would like to connect  your shop to</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If you have not been approved, you will not see the “Shopping” option under “Settings”.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Publish your first shoppable Instagram post!</h3>
<p>You are now ready to start making sales directly from Instagram: upload a photo, and tap to tag. You can tag 5 products per post.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7469" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Untitled.jpg" alt="instagram-shop-and-ecommerce-products-set-up-33" width="400" height="542" /></p>
<p>With over <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 million</a> people using Instagram Stories each day,  ensure you are making the most of this platform. The process for posting on your story is similar, but you can only tag one product per Instagram story.<br />
Once you upload your story, hit the sticker icon on the top-right corner and select “Product”. Then select a product in your catalog.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7483" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Untitled-1.jpg" alt="instagram-shop-and-ecommerce-products-set-up-333" width="400" height="686" /></p>

<p>Sound easy? The one thing you might need more help with is Step 5.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to <strong>include the correct <a href="https://Suvae.org/how-to-create-a-product-data-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product data within your feed</a></strong> to get the most out of your shoppable posts.</p>
<h2>In-depth Instagram Product Feed Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Instagram has different catalog (feed) limitations compared to Facebook Dynamic Product Ads and Google Shopping.</p>
<p>On Instagram, you can <strong>only</strong> <strong>upload 1 feed of your catalog to 1 account.</strong> If you have multiple Instagram accounts for every country/language there is no issue matching country-specific product URLs to each Instagram account.</p>
<p>If you only have <strong>1 master account for your business you may need to look into updating your feed URLs</strong> to be more generic.</p>
<h4><b>Scenario 1:<br /></b>Your website pulls the country and associated language and currency dynamically.</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">In this case, you can update your product URLs to strip out the country. When you tag your product the URL should load the proper country based on the location data it pulls from your IP automatically.</span></p>
<h4><b>Scenario 2:<br /></b>Your website has unique static URLs for every product based on each country and/or language.</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">On Instagram, you can </span><strong style="font-size: 14px;">only upload 1 feed of your catalog to 1 account</strong><span style="font-size: 14px;"> which means you need to </span><strong style="font-size: 14px;">choose 1 set of product URLs to include in your feed</strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">.</span></p>
<p>Someone mousing over your products in a Shoppable Instagram post may not see the product name or price in their language or currency depending on where they are located.</p>
<p><strong>Use your Facebook Dynamic Ads feed for Instagram if you’re only advertising in 1 country, 1 language, and 1 currency. Otherwise, follow the recommendations above to create a custom feed.</strong></p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in making your products shoppable on Instagram, Facebook &amp; Google, <strong>a feed management platform can help you <span style="font-size: 14px;">improve your product advertising &amp; grow your product sales.</span></strong><br /></span><a style="font-size: 14px;" href="https://Suvae.org/contact-us/"><strong>Reach out to the Hightstreet.io</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Team</strong></span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;"> to get started! </span></p></div>
