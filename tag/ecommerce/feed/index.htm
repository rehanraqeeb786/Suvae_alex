										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Successful retailers are always listening to their customers. This not only includes the moments they come into a physical store and speak with an associate. It even goes beyond paying attention to the comments they make on websites and social media platforms. Today, consumers can speak into a variety of digital devices and be heard – as long as brands have voice search optimization in place.</p>
<h2>How Does Voice Search Work for Ecommerce Stores?</h2>
<p>One of the most familiar elements in online retail is a search bar with a magnifying icon next to it. Voice search may find up making the microphone icon almost as popular as consumers switch from typing the names of products they want to simply saying them aloud.</p>
<p>Using voice recognition technology, eCommerce sites that have voice search optimization enabled provides consumers a natural and intuitive way to find everything from luxury fashion to bags, accessories and more.</p>
<h2>Google Voice Search: What it is and How it Works</h2>
<p>Many of us have already experienced voice recognition applications on our smartphones or via smart speakers in our homes. Google Voice Search is just one example, where clicking on the mic icon in the search field or Google app lets consumers look up queries as though they were chatting with a friend.</p>
<h2>Quick Guide to Google Voice Search</h2>
<p>Google Voice Search is powered by Google Assistant, which needs to be activated on your digital device in order to operate. If you want to get a sense of how your customers might experience this kind of technology for shopping purposes, it’s worth trying it out yourself. Here’s how:</p>
<h3><strong>How to Set Up Google Voice Search</strong></h3>
<p>Setting up Google Voice Search is easy. Either open a tab in your browser and visit Google’s website or open the Google app on your smartphone. You’ll need a Google account and be logged in.</p>
<p>Then, move to the Settings area and tun on Google Assistant. Next, look for settings related to Search. Under the “Search,” select “Voice.” If you’re asked to let Google use your microphone, click “Allow.”  Also agree to let Google access your voice and speech activity, which allows the technology to continuously learn and improve.</p>
<h3><strong>What to Do If Google Voice Search Isn&#8217;t Working</strong></h3>
<p>If Google doesn’t seem to be responding to your voice, double-check you’ve allowed the application to access your microphone. You may also want to select an area called Continued Conversation in settings, which will allow you to ask questions without starting with “Hey Google.”</p>
<h3><strong>How to Disable Google Voice Search</strong></h3>
<p>If you don’t want to continue using Google Voice Search once you’ve tested it, just turn it off in the same area within Settings.</p>
<h3><strong>Where to Find Google Voice Search History</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re using Google via a browser, visit a URL called myactivity.google.com and you’ll see everything you’ve looked up. Look for a filter for Google Assistant to isolate this to your voice searches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The importance of voice search optimization in eCommerce</h2>
<p>Given how easy and quick it is to use, retailers that prioritize voice search optimization are in an ideal position to take advantage of an emerging digital channel. This could translate into higher sales volumes, repeat business and improved customer satisfaction.</p>
<h3>Why do you need a voice search optimization strategy?</h3>
<p>Few websites and landing pages were designed with voice search optimization in mind. Fortunately, many of the same search engine optimization (SEO) principals apply. Voice search SEO means you’re essentially trying to develop and structure your content in a way that will make it more likely to be picked up by Google, just in a different mode.</p>
<h2>3 Tips to Optimize Voice Search for your eCommerce</h2>
<ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li><b>Rewrite copy as responses to questions.</b> In your product description for a designer dress, for instance, think of how customers might use voice searches like “Where’s the best selection for designer dresses by XYZ brand?” Your description could then begin with “(Your store) offers the best selection for XYZ brand designer dresses.” Use long-tail keywords in voice search SEO wherever possible.</li>
<li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Use a conversational tone to drive conversions.</b> Edit out jargon and formal phrases on your product and landing pages. Instead, imagine you’re face-to-face with a customer and use conjunctions like “Here’s and “It’s.” Instead of referring to “customers,” use “you.”</li>
<li style="margin-top: 10px;"><b>Ensure product feed management is in place</b>. As with any other channel, voice search should take customers to accurate, up-to-date product data.  <a href="https://highstreet.io/platform/">Automating product feed management</a> makes this a lot easier.</li>
</ol>
<p>Voice search optimization could be the beginning of a new whole conversation with your customers. <a href="https://highstreet.io/contact-us/">Connect with Highstreet.io</a> for more insight into growing your eCommerce business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Expanding your eCommerce sales beyond your brand’s own web site is a big decision. Online marketplaces represent a huge opportunity to reach a much larger addressable market and grow revenues, but it’s important to choose carefully.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://highstreet.io/selling-on-luxury-fashion-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">luxury fashion retailers</a>, for instance, the best way to ensure near-term return on investment (ROI) is to identify online marketplaces that:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li>Specialize in clothing, footwear and accessories, where consumers are actively browsing for products like yours.</li>
<li>Has established a proven track record in driving traffic and engagement with consumers</li>
<li>Offers partnership programs with reasonable terms and enticing seller benefits.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Asos and Zalando: Two specialists in online fashion sales</h2>
<p>Asos and Zalando are perfect examples of digital destinations that meet these criteria. Both have attracted a considerable number of sellers and  have successfully expanded their portfolios in order to satisfy consumer demand.</p>
<p>While it’s possible to integrate with multiple marketplaces simultaneously, many eCommerce strategies involve starting with one. That way you can test the waters in terms of how you promote products on a third-party marketplace and adapt to any rules that have been put in place.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here’s a rundown Asos vs Zalando and how they compare from an online  marketplace perspective:</p>
<h2>Why choose Asos marketplace</h2>
<p>For nearly 25 years, the name “Asos” has become almost synonymous with fast fashion, particularly among younger online shoppers. The company’s success with its own affordable but stylish apparel and accessories has led to several strategic acquisitions, such as Topshop.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Asos marketplace has allowed the brand to significantly expand the selection of products it offers. This not only includes new products but vintage collections, which can be appealing to those focused on sustainability through reuse.</p>
<p>These are the Asos marketplace numbers you need to know:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li>Market share:<a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/54275-95#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 45% of Asos’s sales come from its home market in the U.K.</a>, followed by 30% of other European countries. It also has significant sales from the U.S.</li>
<li>Average customer: More than<a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/asos.com/#demographics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 33% of Asos visitors are between the ages of 25 and 24</a>.</li>
<li>Brand scope: Asos manages 13 of its own brands and offers more than 900 others through the Asos marketplace.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why choose Zalando marketplace</h2>
<p>Selling shoes online was just the first step for the Zalando marketplace. Today the company is a viable online shopping destination for everything from evening gowns to handbags. It is also broadening the scope of its business model, investing in products and capabilities to support business-to-business (B2B) as well as its traditional consumer audience. Its more recent innovations include<a href="https://corporate.zalando.com/en/technology/zalando-launches-size-recommendations-based-customers-own-body-measurements" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a digital tool to predict sizing</a> based on photos submitted by its customers.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Zalando stacks up by the numbers:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li><b>Market share</b>: Zalando commands about<a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/53796-70#:~:text=Zalando%20General%20Information&amp;text=The%20company%20commands%20around%2012,the%20firm%20has%20a%20presence)." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 12% of Europe’s overall sales for apparel products</a>.</li>
<li><b>Average customer</b>: More than <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/zalando.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27% of Zalando’s visitors fall between the ages of 25-34</a>.</li>
<li><b>Brand scope</b>: More than 7,000 brands are available in the Zalando marketplace</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these basic figures, it’s important to consider the policies online marketplace operators have in place to support sellers. Asos doesn’t charge a commission to list products, for instance, and you’re able to upload your entire catalog. Zalando, meanwhile, offers marketing services to help brands advertise on its marketplace as well as a distribution and fulfillment arm.</p>
<h2>Asos vs Zalando: The bottom line</h2>
<p>In the end, both the Asos marketplace and the Zalando marketplace create opportunities for growing brands to find new customers and increase their revenues. Getting started with either, however, depends on effectively managing your product feeds.</p>
<p>Once approved in each company’s partner program, you’ll need to be able to seamlessly transfer data from your product catalogs directly to either marketplace. As you make changes to pricing, product content or introduce new promotions, your feeds will need to remain accurate and up to date. That’s why Highstreet.io offers marketplace integrations for <a href="https://highstreet.io/asos-integration/">Asos</a>, <a href="https://highstreet.io/zalando-integration/">Zalando </a>and dozens of others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The definition of luxury changes when you move from the physical world to online shopping.</p>
<p>Consumers who go looking for luxury fashion in person can appreciate a well-designed space devoted exclusively to a single brand.</p>
<p>They might admire the tasteful décor that sets off the clothes to even greater effect.</p>
<p>An in-person luxury shopping experience also tends to be highly curated – in other words, retailers might only need to showcase their finest goods in order to appeal to discerning customers.</p>
<h2>Why you should sell through a luxury fashion marketplace</h2>
<p>The potential to grow revenues through digital channels requires luxury brands to rethink all of these principals and focus on an entirely different kind of experience.</p>
<p>The key priorities for eCommerce shoppers, including those focused on luxury fashion – are speed, convenience and accurate information.</p>
<p>Consumers expect to find the luxury brands they want instantly. They want as many options as possible in order to make the best choice. And when they’re considering a particular item, they need to feel confident that all the details – especially availability – is up to date.</p>
<p>This helps explain why elite brands are increasingly expanding their digital presence beyond their own web sites and featuring their products through luxury fashion marketplaces.</p>
<p>Far from losing any perception of prestige, adding products to a luxury fashion marketplace shows a brand recognizes that true luxury in eCommerce is all about making it easy to get what you want.</p>
<p>That said, luxury brands should still put the same care and attention into their presence within online marketplaces as they do setting up a physical location.</p>
<p>With the right approach to optimization, your brand will be:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li>Discovered by more consumers</li>
<li>Driving more conversions and revenue</li>
<li>Encourage repeat visits and positive word of mouth</li>
</ul>
<h2>Optimizing eCommerce for a luxury fashion marketplace</h2>
<p>The Internet is already a busy place, where it can be difficult for particular brands to stand out. A lot of the business you drive through your own website will depend on traffic you get through search engine optimization (SEO) and paid marketing tactics.</p>
<p>Joining a luxury fashion marketplace brings you into a more focused environment where consumers are looking for a wide range of brands to explore. However this also means you’ll want to differentiate yourself from other retailers selling within the same space.</p>
<h2>How luxury brands can stand out in an online marketplace</h2>
<p>If you operate physical stores, you probably thought carefully about how they were built and ensured they were easy to stroll through without getting lost. The same principle applies online.</p>
<h3>Introduce yourself (and reinforce your brand identity)</h3>
<p>Your logo is only one element that tells consumers who you are and why you represent a brand worth exploring.</p>
<p>Remember that some of those browsing a luxury marketplace may not be familiar with you at all. Make the best possible impression by including information such as a condensed version of your mission and any relevant details about your history and reputation.</p>
<p>Others may come on a luxury fashion marketplace hoping to find your brand included, and these details will reassure them the experience you’re offering will be consistent with what they’ve seen elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Let each product description tell a compelling story</h3>
<p>Offering basic details such as sizes, colors and pricing are just a starting point when you’re positioning your products through a luxury clothing marketplace.</p>
<p>Converting browsers into buyers is all about making them understand your brand’s unique approach to developing quality apparel and accessories. This can include the materials you use, the craftsmanship you apply and more.</p>
<p>The copywriting you do here can make the difference between attracting a customer who stays with you for life and one who chooses to browse another brand instead.</p>
<h3>Ensure every image offers maximum appeal</h3>
<p>You don’t always need ideal lighting when you’re selling products in a physical store because shoppers can touch and feel them directly. In a luxury clothing marketplace, pictures represent the most powerful way for you to convey the beauty and style of every item.</p>
<p>Choose images that not only provide a clear view of what you’re selling but create a sense of aspiration. This can mean showing products from different angles and incorporating lifestyle elements, such as a model wearing a product in an attractive everyday setting.</p>
<h3>Use data analytics to inform the most meaningful changes</h3>
<p>Retailers always keep a close eye on the number of products they sell, but being on a luxury marketplace can offer other data points that can help you continuously improve how you showcase your products.</p>
<p>Look for ways to measure the time spent on each product, shopping cart abandonment rates and anything specific provided by a marketplace operator to fine-tune your approach. The more data-driven you can be as a retailer, the more likely you’ll be able to reach or even exceed your eCommerce goals.</p>
<h2>The best luxury fashion marketplace options for premium brands</h2>
<p>Your sales strategy for luxury marketplaces can begin by identifying which platforms align best with your ideal customer profile and brand. In doing so you’ll also want to take into account the level of active users each platform offers, seller requirements and the options for handling shipping and returns.</p>
<p>Some brands start by integrating with a single luxury marketplace and taking a “test and learn” approach before adding others. Once you’ve learned what’s involved in getting set up – and when you have partners with the technologies to help automate the process – it can be easier to expand into other luxury clothing marketplaces over time.</p>
<p>Some of the most common platforms where other luxury brands are actively selling right now include:</p>
<h3>Zalando</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-18546" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Secrets-of-selling-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" /></p>
<p>It’s already one of Europe’s most popular online destinations for luxury fashion, but<a href="https://highstreet.io/zalando-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Zalando</a> is continuing to make changes that could strengthen its market position even further.</p>
<p>In early 2024, for example,<a href="https://internetretailing.net/zalando-targets-both-b2c-and-b2b-in-growth-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Zalando announced it is working to enrich some of its existing categories</a>, including Sports and Kids &amp; Family through technologies that will personalize the inspiration it provides. Tools like Zalando Assistant, meanwhile, is allowing commerce to become more conversational – almost akin to the expert help luxury brands have traditionally provided in-store through expert associates.</p>
<p><a href="https://fashionunited.uk/news/business/zalando-targets-a-larger-share-of-the-fashion-e-commerce-market-with-new-ecosystem/2024031374584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zalando has also said it is opening up its logistics infrastructure, software and service capabilities</a> to help retailers sell more effectively to customers.</p>
<h3>Asos</h3>
<p>Luxury clothing isn’t limited to new merchandise. Many shoppers go online looking for vintage collections and the latest collections at the same time. Asos has a marketplace that has been successful in both kinds of clothing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1252308/asos-marketplace-second-hand-apparel-online-shops-brand-profile-in-the-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brand awareness for the Asos marketplace is 65% in the U.K. alone</a>, and 80% of its customers tend to be loyal to the brand. That could mean a lot of return visits for luxury brands who feature products on the Asos marketplace.</p>
<p>In the meantime,<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/uks-asos-sinks-first-half-loss-names-dave-murray-cfo-2024-04-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Asos in early 2024 appointed a new CFO</a> whose eCommerce experience includes a stint at Amazon, suggesting Asos will become even more competitive in the fashion sector.</p>
<h3>Farfetch</h3>
<p>From the moment it launched in 2007,<a href="https://highstreet.io/integrazione-marketplace-farfetch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Farfetch</a> has been focused on acting as a trusted partner to brands that want to be included on the top global luxury fashion marketplace.</p>
<p>This means Farfetch doesn’t carry any inventory of its own but provides third-party services to help other luxury brands find sales success.</p>
<p>In early 2024,<a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2023/12/18/coupang-to-acquire-farfetch-assets-in-500-million-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Farfetch was acquired by South Korean eCommerce giant Coupang</a>, which said it would invest in helping the marketplace to further improve the customer experience for luxury shoppers around the world.</p>
<h2>Bet on the most sought-after luxury brands and increase sales</h2>
<p>The best sales strategy for luxury marketplaces always takes into account what other premium brands are doing online. Even as you begin uploading your products to the kinds of platforms we’ve just described, you should continue to monitor and assess competitors whose activities could provide insight on eCommerce best practices as they emerge.</p>
<p>Some of the parameters to keep in mind here:</p>
<h3>The most searched luxury brands online</h3>
<p><a href="https://us.fashionnetwork.com/news/Louis-vuitton-gucci-most-searched-for-luxury-brands-in-2023-according-to-google-data,1570517.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Dior are the “big three”</a> in terms of what consumers are keying into Google, according to recent data. Pay attention to the keywords these brands are using to rank in search results, and how you might weave them into your own copy.</p>
<h3>The most profitable luxury brands online</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/5-most-valuable-luxury-companies-in-the-world-1261298/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LVMH scores the top spot in this category as well</a>, followed by luxury brands such as Dior, Hermes and EssilorLuxottica, among others. While profitability is driven from many different facets, these brands represent the ideal in how they balance supply and demand as they serve style-conscious consumers</p>
<h3>The most in-demand luxury fashion brands online</h3>
<p>It may be a subjective area, but shopping app <a href="https://fashionista.com/2024/01/lyst-index-top-popular-brands-products-2023-q4-prada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyst’s most recent quarterly index</a> said Prada is the hottest luxury brand, followed by Miu Miu, Loewe and Bottega Veneta. Use this kind of ranking to consider the most creative approaches luxury brands can take in how they market themselves online as you prepare your product listings and images to upload onto online marketplaces.</p>
<h2>The most important luxury fashion marketplace best practice of all</h2>
<p>Luxury brands have to be good at many different things at once: designing products, creating compelling marketing content and providing outstanding customer service.</p>
<p>That means they shouldn’t be bogged down with the technical aspects of getting their products on a luxury clothing marketplace. Automating this process through a product feed management solution is the smartest move you can make as you prepare to boost your long-term eCommerce sales.<a href="https://highstreet.io/contact-us/"> Connect with us</a> to find out how we can assist with integration across more than 50 of the top marketplaces in the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most successful ads don’t feel like marketing. They’re so relevant to your interests and aspirations you welcome the value they provide.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional banner ads and pop-ups that consumers might scroll past on a website, Google Ad campaigns have proven effective in helping brands show up in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>When someone types into its search engine, for example, they’re hoping to find a list of links that will take them where they want to go. Google Ad campaigns go beyond these basic search results by showcasing brands that relate to each query. If you’re serious about selling online, they’re a critical tool.</p>
<h2>Google Ads: What they are and how campaigns work</h2>
<p>Originally launched as Google AdWords, Google Ads is the search engine company’s platform for powering online advertising across its flagship site, partner sites and YouTube. It offers ads in a variety of formats depending on a brand’s needs such as text, video, display and banner ads.</p>
<p>Google also offers some proprietary options such as Google Shopping Ads, Performance Max ads and Responsive Search ads.</p>
<p>Launching Google Ad campaigns requires bidding for placement based on keywords and the search volume they get, when the ads will run and the expected reach.</p>
<p>Before getting into the details of bidding and running your ads, however, you’ll have to set up a Google Ads account first.</p>
<h2>How to create an account in Google ads</h2>
<p>You’ll need a regular Google account for your business to set up an account in Google Ads. You might have a personal Gmail account already, but for marketing purposes start by visiting <a href="http://accounts.google.com">Accounts.Google.com</a> and choose the option “to manage my business” when you’re asked why you’re signing up.</p>
<p>Once that’s done and you’re logged in, visit <a href="http://ads.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ads.Google.com.</a> You’ll be asked to create a Google Ad campaign right away, but look towards the bottom the screen and click on “Switch to expert mode.” This gives you more time to find your way around the Google Ad Manager dashboard, learn about developing a successful campaign and other Google Ads best practices.</p>
<h2>How to create a campaign in Google Ad Manager: 5 steps to follow</h2>
<p>With the right planning, you can use your Google Ad Manager to get your products seen by more people who are ready to make a purchase:</p>
<h3>1. Enter the Google Ad Manager Dashboard</h3>
<p><span style="padding-left: 20px;">Once you’re inside Google Ad Manager, you’ll see a link that says “Create New Campaign” on your dashboard.</span></p>
<h3>2. Choose your marketing objective and campaign type</h3>
<div style="padding-left: 20px;">
<p>Some brands use Google Ads to encourage e-mail signups, initiate phone calls or live chats and download other forms of content. If your focus is on eCommerce, you should select “purchases” as your campaign goal.</p>
<p>From there, you’ll select the type of campaigns that<a href="https://highstreet.io/local-inventory-ads-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> put you in the best position to reach your goal</a>. Familiarize yourself with as many kinds as possible. There are details on some of the most common ad formats in the next section below.</p>
</div>
<h3>3.  Choose your Google Ad bidding strategy</h3>
<div style="padding-left: 20px;">Remember that running a Google Ad campaign means you’re competing with others brands that might be interested in targeting the same kinds of customers. That means you’ll have to determine what kind of budget you’ll allocate towards bidding and whether the money will be spent on how many people see your ad vs. how many people click on it. We’ll delve into the pros and cons of each choice later in this guide. Google can help optimize much of the bidding process if you’re new to these campaigns.</div>
<h3>4. Set up your Google Ad target audience</h3>
<div style="padding-left: 20px;">Precision marketing is all about serving ads to the most appropriate people. Google Ad Manager <a href="https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/6022732?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/6022732?hl=en</a> offers many ways to get granular in how you set up target segments. You can focus specifically for those searching for women’s apparel, for instance, as well as country-specific locations like Italy or the U.S. and language. Make sure not to set your parameters too narrowly until you’ve gotten more experience with these campaigns.</div>
<h3>5. Develop an ad that converts</h3>
<div style="padding-left: 20px;">You’ll drive more purchases using Google Ads when you have compelling content that creatively combines text and images. Take advantage of freely available generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to assist with writing strong titles, body copy and optimizing product and lifestyle imagery. Once you’re done, your Google Ad campaign can begin.</div>
<div></div>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Types of Google ads campaigns</h2>
<p>People consume information in a variety of formats, so think about A/B testing with a couple of different approaches depending on what you’re selling and what your audience needs to see in order to move forward:</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Google has an extensive network of partner sites where it can run display ads that predominantly feature images or videos. This can be a good option for when you’re trying to build initial brand awareness and introduce your company and its products to the market.</p>
<h3>Shopping</h3>
<p>Customers want the basics before they buy. This includes the product name, the price and the seller, all of which are presented through Google Shopping Ads. Having<a href="https://highstreet.io/fix-price-mismatch-google-shopping-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> product feeds that can send data directly from your product catalog are essentia</a>l in order to have Google Shopping Ads perform as expected.</p>
<h3>App</h3>
<p>This is only so much space on a smartphone screen, which means consumers are becoming more discerning about what they install. Google app ads can use a mix of images, video and text to get the downloads you need to grow your business, especially if your app makes it easy for customers to place and track their orders.</p>
<h3>Local Inventory Ads</h3>
<p>One of the biggest opportunities in eCommerce is to<a href="https://highstreet.io/local-inventory-ads-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> market products based on where customers can easily go and pick them up in person</a>. Local inventory ads (LIAs) ensure you only promote what’s in stock near your audience’s current location. A strong product feed management solution is critical here, too.</p>
<h2>How much does Google ads cost? Find out the minimum budget to launch your campaign</h2>
<p>The budget you’ll need to run a Google Ad campaign will vary depending on the industry you’re targeting, average search volume and many other factors. These costs will change over time, but as of early 2024 the average cost per click for a category such as fashion retail, for instance, was US$1.42.</p>
<h2>CPC or CPM?</h2>
<p>Paying on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis means your budget is going directly towards driving activity to your product pages and eCommerce engine. This can be a sound strategy when you’re focused on short-term revenue goals. In other cases, paying on a cost-per-thousand impressions (CPM) basis can allow you to build your reputation among your audience, which can be important for bigger-ticket items that have a longer buying cycle.</p>
<h2>What is Google Ads Keyword Planner and how to choose the most effective keywords</h2>
<p>Google recognizes that not everyone is highly versed in running online ad campaigns. Its Keyword Planner is a tool that provides rich data such as search volume for particular combinations of words, forecasts and much more.</p>
<p>You can look up individual words or upload a CSV file with all the relevant keywords in your industry to identify what you’ll use in your Google Ads.</p>
<p>Choosing the most effective keyword is really a process of putting yourself in your customers’ shoes and imagining what they would type into a search engine when they’re looking for their next purchase.</p>
<h2>Managing Google Ad campaigns: the Highstreet.io solution</h2>
<p>Running Google Ads can involve meeting highly specific requirements, which is not something you’ll want to manage on your own.</p>
<p>Highstreet.io’s product feed management platform makes it easy to <b>tailor your product data to whatever channel you’re using</b> for marketing purposes. This includes a range of Google Ad formats such as Google Shopping Ads, local inventory ads and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting an eCommerce business used to mean dealing with a lot of overhead costs and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Besides manufacturing products, you had to set up a warehouse to store your inventory. You’d need to buy trucks. Then you’d have to hire reliable staff to drive them.</p>
<p>This was all before figuring out how to ship products across multiple countries and currencies.</p>
<p>Then came dropshipping. What is it? For many people, dropshipping is a business model that has made online entrepreneurship possible for the first time.</p>
<h2>Dropshipping: what it is and how it works</h2>
<p>Dropshipping means you’re outsourcing key areas of fulfilling eCommerce orders. This includes procuring products, storing and shipping them to customers.</p>
<p>How to dropship depends on the partners and providers you use. In the most common scenarios, your focus as a seller is on marketing and attracting customers to your online storefront or marketplace. Then, as orders get placed, sellers confirm them to customers, pass the order information to their dropshipping service partners who fulfill them.</p>
<p>For sellers who master how dropshipping works, eCommerce becomes highly efficient. Instead of making their own products, for instance, they can sell goods from other vendors and take a cut. As long as they can ensure a good customer experience across the entire eCommerce journey, it can be a profitable business model.</p>
<p>Researchers estimate<a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/dropshipping-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> dropshipping will grow on a global level by nearly 24%</a> between now and 2032, becoming a market worth more than $1.9 billion.</p>
<p>That said, sellers shouldn’t be fooled by images of sitting by the beach running an eCommerce business with little more than a laptop. Dropshipping has become highly competitive. You have to keep a close eye on profit margins and other key data points. Supply chain disruptions can grind your business to a halt. There are also a number of legal issues and liability risks to consider.</p>
<p>This post will not only answer the question, ‘Dropshipping: what is it?” We’ll also walk through the essential areas you need to know. We’ll not only cover what dropshipping is, but the differences of dropshipping on Amazon and other marketplaces.  We’ll also look at the technologies you need you have in place for dropshipping and how to get started.</p>
<h2>Dropshipping without a VAT number: Is it possible?</h2>
<p>Dropshipping allows you to begin thinking about growing your business on an international scale from the moment you launch. While digital channels have made it easier to market and sell to customers in almost any geography, you also have to take into consideration legislation that governs these processes. The United Kingdom’s value-added tax (VAT) is a good example. Read before you try dropshipping without a VAT number.</p>
<p>Having a VAT number is a standard practice for many businesses, but the<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> requirements from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)</a> differ depending on where you operate. This is true for those using dropshipping suppliers as well. If you’re based in the U.K., for example, you’ll only need to register for a VAT number if your turnover exceeds more than £85,000 a year.</p>
<p>For those selling from outside the U.K., however, dropshipping without a VAT number is impossible if your target market includes U.K. customers. This includes those based in Italy or many other countries.</p>
<p>Fortunately, HMRC has simplified the process by offering VAT number registration through its website. Remember to talk to your accountant about whether expenses associated with VAT registration and import fees can be written off as part of filing your business taxes.</p>
<h3>ATECO code for dropshipping</h3>
<p>One of the most critical steps in getting your VAT number is using the correct ATECO code. First introduced by the Italian National Institute of Statistics in 2008, ATECO codes are a combination of letters and numbers that classify businesses according to the scope of their economic activity. This informs your business in terms of tax rates and social security contributions.</p>
<p>In this case, the ATECO code for eCommerce businesses, including those that use dropshipping services, is 47.91.10. It applies to both online stores that operate as a single brand as well as marketplace entities such as eBay, Amazon and Zalando.</p>
<p>Once you’ve submitted your ATECO code as part of the VAT registration process, you’ll also need to<a href="https://www.inps.it/en/en.information-english.contributions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> register your business with INPS</a> to determine how much you’ll pay in contributions based on your business revenue. There are also<a href="https://accountingbolla.com/blog/business-setup/e-commerce-in-italy/#How_much_does_it_cost_to_open_a_VAT_number_in_E-commerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> fees you’ll need to pay to the Chamber of Commerce and municipality</a> in which you’re operating. These range from €53.00 to a maximum of € 128.00. Always do your research to check for any changes to these requirements and consult a taxation or accounting expert to field any other questions.</p>
<h2>Dropshipping suppliers: Which are the most reliable?</h2>
<p>Although dropshipping takes away many of the headaches associated with selling online, you’ll only succeed based on the quality of your partners.</p>
<p>When you’re looking at manufacturers, for example, you may want to order samples to ensure your customers will get quality items. There should be consistency between what they see on your web site and what arrives at their doorstep, for example. It should work or fit as customers expect.</p>
<p>You also can’t afford to sell products that arrive damaged or incomplete. Items should be properly packaged and in a reasonable timeframe. For some product categories, pricing can be highly competitive, and you don’t want to opt for a manufacturer whose prices will cut in too heavily to your profit margin.</p>
<p>Apply the same attention to detail when you seek out dropshipping suppliers who will handle other stages of your customer experience. Depending on your target market, you’ll want to work with those who have warehouses in reasonable proximity to your customers to save on shipping costs. Suppliers should also be able to demonstrate speed and efficiency in every stage of fulfillment and delivery.</p>
<p>Take the time to discuss critical processes that will have an impact on customer satisfaction and your overall reputation. Things can always go wrong with e-commerce orders, whether it’s sending the wrong size or the customer simply changes their mind. Choose suppliers with reasonable return policies and refund policies. Check to see that they have adequate insurance to cover off any unfortunate errors.</p>
<p>Some sellers launch their business by having a network of several different suppliers that handle each aspect of manufacturing, order management and fulfillment. Another option is to work through an online marketplace. These sites may already have the visitor traffic you need to entice the kind of customers you want.</p>
<p>Better yet, marketplaces often operate a range of dropshipping services that make the process far more streamlined. Here are some of the most common examples:</p>
<h3>Amazon dropshipping</h3>
<p><a href="https://sell.amazon.com/blog/dropshipping-on-amazon">Amazon</a> is one of the best-known marketplaces in the world, especially in North America. That means there are likely a lot of potential customers browsing for their next purchase, which could include what you’re trying to sell.</p>
<p>Amazon dropshipping rules include making sure you’re the seller of record. This means you’re not only registered to let consumers make purchases, but that you’re setting prices and taking responsibility for returns. Even if you have other dropshipping suppliers shipping orders, you’re accountable to collecting sales tax and recording your revenue.</p>
<h3>eBay dropshipping</h3>
<p>It may have started as an online auction house, but eBay has become another giant in eCommerce and sees<a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/ebay.com/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> nearly 740 million visitors a month</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest consideration for eBay dropshipping is to<a href="https://export.ebay.com/en/shipping/shipping-tips-and-best-practice/drop-shipping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ensure you own the product you’re selling</a>. For example, eBay does not allow you to take orders for a product from a listing you’ve posted and then purchase from another party that is also selling on eBay.</p>
<p>As long as you have a dropshipping supplier who can store your products on your behalf – or if you have a wholesale agreement – you can drop ship on eBay, which it also calls “product sourcing.” Other standard eBay dropshipping policies include making sure your items arrive safely based on the timeframe your listing includes, and that you take ownership of customer satisfaction and service.</p>
<h3>Zalando dropshipping</h3>
<p>With a focus on selling clothing and accessories, Zalando has continued to become a huge player in the European eCommerce market. Its most recent reports showed the<a href="https://corporate.zalando.com/en/financials/zalando-full-year-22-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> overall volume of active customers have grown by 6%, reaching a total of more than 51 million shoppers</a>.</p>
<p>Dropshipping on Zalando can be done through its<a href="https://partnerportal.zalando.com/partners/s/article/Get-to-know-Zalando-Partner-Program" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Partner Program</a>, which provides sellers not only with access to its marketplace but resources such as Zalando Partner University and the ZDirect platform to manage your online presence. Zalando governs dropshipping and other sales approaches based on its<a href="https://partnerportal.zalando.com/partners/s/article/Customer-Experience-Model-CXM-an-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> customer experience model (CXM)</a>, a set of key performance indicators it monitors to ensure it has the right members in its partner program.</p>
<h2>What to sell through dropshipping? Discover the most searched products</h2>
<p>The dropshipping model works for almost any physical product. You can find sellers who have been successful creating eCommerce businesses around everything from air fryers and camping gear to interior décor and pet toys. Fashion, however, represents one of the most promising dropshipping niches.</p>
<p>In a study that compared categories such as electronics, toys, furniture and food,<a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/dropshipping-market#:~:text=The%20global%20dropshipping%20market%20size%20was%20estimated%20at%20USD%20225.99,USD%20287.36%20billion%20in%202023." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> fashion emerged as the top dropshipping segment</a>. The same research has forecast fashion dropshipping to reach a compound annual growth rate of nearly 25% by 2030.</p>
<p>Signature clothing and apparel is a natural choice for dropshipping sellers. The products are always in-demand among online shoppers and easy to advertise through digital channels such as social media. Luxury fashion and style products also present considerable upsell and cross-selling opportunities, given that footwear and accessories can often complement existing purchases.</p>
<p>A category like fashion also provides a good reminder of choosing the right supplier. Signature clothing may be more prone to competition and returns, which means sellers should aim for providing an experience that is as easy and seamless as possible. Customers will expect to find the items they want quickly, and feel confident they’re ordering what is already in stock.</p>
<h2>How much can you earn through dropshipping?</h2>
<p>The revenue you’ll generate by operating your eCommerce brand with dropshipping services can be difficult to predict. Research the following areas to inform your calculations:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li><b>Google trending searches:</b> Use keywords that represent your niche and its products and get a sense of how often consumers are using them as they browse online. This can give an indication of current and future demand.</li>
<li><b>Average order value:</b> Explore retail industry analyst studies that show how much consumers tend to spend on the kind of products you’ll be selling.</li>
<li><b>Average monthly visitors:</b> Estimate the traffic you could achieve through online advertising and other marketing tactics. Alternatively, look at visits to popular online marketplaces where you could feature your brand.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these data points in place, you can develop a conservative estimate based on a conversion rate of 1.01% and 1.04% and apply it to your expected average monthly visitors based on the average order value.</p>
<p>Successful sellers spend a lot of time in this area, factoring in macroeconomic conditions, tracking regional online shopping trends and ongoing analysis of the top competitors in their respective niche.</p>
<h2>Dropshipping and invoices: Step-by-step operation</h2>
<p>Managing stock, order fulfillment and other areas bring a lot of value to busy eCommerce sellers, and your suppliers deserve to be paid consistently and on time.</p>
<p>Invoicing for dropshipping services works a little differently than in a traditional physical retail environment, where a customer pays a merchant directly for a product it manufactured itself. The process usually looks something like this:</p>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>A consumer browses the seller’s virtual store, which is fed with product catalog data connected to all key suppliers.</p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Consumers place orders which are sent by the seller to the dropshipping suppliers, who then fulfill the orders.</p>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Suppliers generate a purchase order and invoice the seller for each item. This is where special discounts, dropshipping service fees, returns allowances and other terms are applied.</p>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Sellers pay the invoices, often through a business credit card or payment portal.</p>
<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>Suppliers sent a receipt to sellers confirming payment.</p>
<p>Sometimes sellers can work out agreements with suppliers to be invoiced on a weekly or monthly basis. Volume discounts may also be available for sellers who manage to achieve high conversions and orders.</p>
<p>While dropshipping and invoicing may look simple at a high level, there’s a lot that can go wrong behind the scenes. That’s because everything in the steps above is predicated upon using accurate and up-to-date data across both seller and supplier eCommerce platforms.</p>
<p>Invoices don’t just been to be dated properly, for instance. Each one needs to be associated with a PO number from the seller’s ordering system. Ship dates, tracking number, delivery method, handling fees, miscellaneous charges – these are all key pieces of the puzzle. The invoice status needs to be recognized too, as either “outstanding” or “paid.”</p>
<p>Besides ensuring all parties are clear on return policies and handling fees, sellers and dropshipping suppliers will need to negotiate whether batch invoicing is permitted. Advertising co-op dollars and rules around paying for single-item orders are just two examples of other variables to consider. When it’s done well, invoicing should be a simple formality that both dropshipping suppliers and sellers take for granted.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s a reason consumers pay attention when they see a social media post with the hashtag “trending.”</p>
<p>No one wants to miss a popular video on TikTok. Everyone wants to see what others are saying about a hot topic in the news. If they’re in a shopping mood, “trending” could indicate their next must-have purchase.</p>
<p>Brands need to keep an eye on what’s trending too, but from a different perspective. What you’re watching for are the <b>retail marketing trends </b>that show how consumer expectations are evolving when they shop on eCommerce sites.</p>
<p>When you know the trends in eCommerce, you’re in a better position to offer the right products at the right time. You’re able to deliver a customer experience with minimal friction. Most importantly, you’re able to drive better results in terms of revenue, repeat purchases and positive word of mouth.</p>
<h2>Key eCommerce Trends for 2024</h2>
<p>Keeping up with eCommerce trends can feel like a full-time job in itself. To that end, we’ve compiled some of the most critical research to fine-tune your strategy over the next year and beyond:</p>
<h3>1. AI is already transforming online shopping for the better</h3>
<p>Whether brands use AI to recommend products or power chatbots that troubleshoot customer service issues, artificial intelligence is no longer a futuristic nice-to-have. In fact,<a href="https://www.talkdesk.com/blog/ai-holiday-shopping-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 72% of retailers believe an AI-enhanced shopping experience is giving them a competitive advantage</a>, and two-thirds (69%) expect it will boost customer loyalty (70%).</p>
<p>AI can take many forms, from generative AI to machine learning (ML). The one common denominator is that the technology needs to be trained on quality data. That means you should be looking at <a href="https://highstreet.io/product-feed-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solutions that allow you to easily manage product catalogs and inventory data</a>. The more accurate and up to date your keep pricing, quantities and other information, the more ROI you’ll get from tools like AI.</p>
<h3>2. eCommerce growth opportunities abound outside the holiday season</h3>
<p>The conventional wisdom is that retail marketing efforts should focus on peak periods such as the days leading up to U.S. Thanksgiving or Christmas. Based on market research, however,<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-09-12-gartner-marketing-survey-finds-only-9-percent-of-consumers-plan-to-spend-more-this-holiday-season" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> only 9% of consumers plan to spend more during the holidays. Instead, 19% have been shopping year-round</a>, a figure that increased from 16% the year before.</p>
<p>This speaks to the value of taking a consistent approach to <a href="https://highstreet.io/marketing-channels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feeding product data across relevant channels at all times</a>, and using personalization to entice shoppers. That’s a lot better than relying on only a few days on the calendar to grow your business.</p>
<h3>3. Costs are the No. 1 cause of cart abandonment</h3>
<p>If consumers are giving up before completing their online order, it’s difficult to get them back. Not surprisingly, nearly<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-cost-conundrum-new-data-unveils-top-reasons-shoppers-abandon-online-carts-301990095.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 20% of consumers say they abandon digital shopping carts do to shipping costs</a>, while nearly the same percentage believe they might find a product cheaper elsewhere.</p>
<p>The lesson? Use <a href="https://highstreet.io/local-inventory-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product listings on search engines</a> and other retail marketing channels to convey that you have the best price, and save consumers from looking around for a better deal. If you offer free shipping (or free shipping based on an amount spent) make that clear in your advertising too.</p>
<h3>4. Mobile web is preferable to apps</h3>
<p>Retailers may wonder if they should be allocating more to their own site or encourage consumers to download and install a branded app on their phone. However,<a href="https://www.glassbox.com/blog/cyber-weekend-shopping-plans-survey-says-digital-experiences-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 84% of consumers said they be willing to install and shop through a retailer’s mobile app if it gave them access to better sales or pricing</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16890" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/zalando.jpg" alt="Unless you want to create a unique experience through an app" width="750" height="500" /></p>
<p>Unless you want to create a unique experience through an app, investing in your web site and online marketplaces where consumers are more likely to shop is a better idea.</p>
<h3>5. Creators become a critical retail marketing partner</h3>
<p>Traditional online advertising and marketing isn’t going away, but brands are also recognizing there are influencers with followings far larger and more engaged than their own. That’s why<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231108196675/en/The-Next-Wave-of-Creator-Marketing-New-Study-from-LTK-and-Northwestern-University-Retail-Analytics-Council" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 92% of Brands Report Creator Marketing Budgets will Increase in 2024</a>. That means, beyond promoting products through campaigns on ad networks and through the social media accounts they manage, brands work with creators to develop authentic stories that reflect the interests and needs of their customers too.</p>
<p>Remember that no matter what kind of content they create, creators are just as reliant on providing their product data their followers can trust. Think of this as yet another component of an omnichannel marketing effort, where the right solutions will allow to distribute data in a streamlined manner.</p>
<h2>Total sales and marketplace revenue</h2>
<p>Despite periods of high inflation and other economic challenges, there’s ample reason to believe that capitalizing on eCommerce trends will help retail marketing efforts pay off handsomely over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Globally, eCommerce revenue is forecast to grow 9% in 2024, with worldwide sales topping $5.8 trillion.</p>
<p>The opportunity isn’t limited to selling products through your own brand’s web site. The long-term outlook for<a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/online-marketplaces-top-600-billion-us-retail-sales-2027" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and Walmart is pegged to grow to $600 billion in U.S. sales</a> alone. Capitalizing on the potential of selling through third parties depends on having the ability to <a href="https://highstreet.io/marketplace-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manage marketplace integration with speed and agility</a>. Make this a top priority in 2024.</p>
<h2>Retail marketing tips to act on eCommerce trends</h2>
<p>Trends in eCommerce only matter if you can use them to turn more browsers into buyers. Here’s how:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Conduct a data-driven eCommerce audit:</b> You’re sitting on more data than you might realize. There’s never a bad time to take a step back and study which channels drove the greatest performance, which didn’t and to refocus your efforts accordingly.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Capture the voice of the customer:</b> If you don’t already, look at touchpoints where you’re already engaging with customers, such as e-mail. Use surveys and polls to gather feedback about their key shopping preferences to ensure your retail marketing tactics align with them.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Consult with experts about building a better tech stack:</b> When you’re heads-down in your daily work, it’s difficult to keep track of emerging technologies that could help you accomplish your goals. Set aside time for discussions with vendors you trust about the latest innovations and how you could apply them.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every retailer renovates their stores occasionally, and they often go well beyond adding a fresh coat of paint.</p>
<p>The layout of the aisles may get reconfigured for easier browsing.</p>
<p>New displays and signage clarify where shoppers can find their favorite product categories.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale systems get moved and self-checkout kiosks are set up to streamline purchasing.</p>
<p>Even if they make major changes, though, brands are essentially working within the same three-dimensional space of four walls, a ceiling, and a floor.</p>
<p>An eCommerce renovation – even a minor one – is more complicated. That’s why the difference between composable commerce vs. headless approaches matters.</p>
<h2>What is the difference between composable commerce vs. headless?</h2>
<p>When brands set up their first eCommerce sites, they couldn’t have anticipated the way shoppers would not only browse on desktop PCs but also on their smartphones.</p>
<p>The same goes for social media platforms, which evolved from places to share content with friends and family to a showcase for all manner of fashion and luxury goods.</p>
<p>Who would have realized that brands could not only sell through their site but Amazon, Zalando, and even<a href="https://highstreet.io/unlock-the-potential-of-macys-marketplace-with-integration-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> online marketplaces from the likes of Macy’s</a>?</p>
<p><a href="https://highstreet.io/category/marketing-channels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Every new digital channel that emerges</a> represents a huge opportunity for brands. Think of each one as a new door that gets added to a physical store. In reality, however, adding those doors can prove daunting. Existing technology platforms can prove rigid or inflexible to integrate more channels.</p>
<p>If you’re weighing composable vs. headless options for the future of your eCommerce business, it’s probably because they each represent a more fluid and dynamic way to tackle these challenges. Here’s how to distinguish between the two:</p>
<h3>Headless architecture</h3>
<p>The design of an eCommerce site may vary largely among brands, but the underlying architecture is usually the same. There is a front end that customers see, usually based on a content management system (CMS) to display creative elements like images and text. There is also the back-end, which can handle everything from capturing and processing orders to feeding into a CRM and other systems.</p>
<p>The key characteristic of headless vs. composable commerce is that it essentially consists of decoupling or separating these two areas of functionality and using an API to facilitate communication from one to the other.</p>
<p>This allows the backend to continue running as it should while allowing brands to optimize the CMS to work with social media, wearables, and even VR/AR channels. It opens up the ability to create customer experiences based on particular personas, segments, or business models.</p>
<h3>Composable commerce architecture</h3>
<p>What sets composable commerce vs. headless, on the other hand, is an even greater ability to customize eCommerce experiences.</p>
<p>A composable commerce architecture uses microservices to treat functions as a series of modules.</p>
<p>When you migrate to composable commerce with the right partner solutions, for instance, it becomes far easier to orchestrate the connection between a brand’s product catalog, order management system, inventory management system, and ERP via that API.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16626" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Composable-commerce-arc.png" alt="Composable commerce architecture" width="750" height="996" /></p>
<p>Whether your business goal is to enhance ad retargeting, adopt a new social media service, or sell on an online marketplace, a composable commerce platform allows you to “compose” your tech stack without introducing performance or interoperability issues. Instead, those front-end customer touchpoints and back-end operations can be mixed and matched as required.</p>
<p>Just as fashionable consumers create a perfect ensemble by selecting the ideal top, shirt, shoes, and jewelry, a composable commerce architecture provides brands the freedom to curate the ideal tech stack.</p>
<h2>What are composable commerce vs. headless pros and cons?</h2>
<p>As you assess the potential headless and composable commerce benefits, keep in mind the following:</p>
<h3>Headless architecture pros:</h3>
<ul style="margin-left: 15px !important;">
<li>Faster time to deploying new eCommerce experiences such as smart mirrors and progressive web applications (PWAs)</li>
<li>More options in terms of the CMS used to adapt emerging digital channels</li>
<li>The ability to make changes to the CMS or backend without one negatively impacting the other.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Headless architecture cons:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Greater complexity and maintenance requirements based on potentially using more than one CMS</li>
<li>Greater costs to build eCommerce experiences specific to each digital channel</li>
<li>Platform limitations: Depending on your business needs there may not always be a large number of platforms that support headless commerce.</li>
<li>Potential API rate limits and GET request limits based on fetching multiple product catalogs to support multiple markets</li>
</ul>
<h3>Composable commerce architecture pros:</h3>
<ul style="margin-left: 15px !important;">
<li>The greatest possible range of features and vendor integrations to build into an eCommerce experience</li>
<li>Increased scalability of new features and channels as your business grows</li>
<li>A utilization model based on business need, reducing the risk of over-investing in technology</li>
<li>Increased speed to modify or make changes by substituting or upgrading specific modules without a negative impact on other modules or core systems</li>
</ul>
<h3>Composable commerce architecture cons:</h3>
<ul style="margin-left: 15px !important;">
<li>Potentially larger pool of vendor relationships to manage as additional microservices are added to the overall eCommerce experience</li>
<li>Greater onus on orchestrating microservices and modules without jeopardizing performance and security</li>
<li>Increased complexity in integrating with multiple online marketplaces in addition to a brand’s own eCommerce website.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Choosing between composable commerce vs. headless architecture</h2>
<p>Resolving the debate over headless vs. composable commerce should begin, as with any critical business decision, by looking at your current and future customer needs.</p>
<p>Use existing data about customer behavior to indicate how their digital habits are changing, and whether providing the best possible experience will require adding more channels. Complement this with market research that helps validate the shifts in customer journeys you’ve perceived.</p>
<p>Next, consider the impact of your eCommerce evolution on your team. A composable commerce platform or headless CMS, for example, could provide greater uptime, faster upgrades, and more manageable growth. This is the thinking behind what is now known as<a href="https://highstreet.io/mach-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> MACH principles</a>, where architecture is microservices-based, API-first, cloud-native, and headless.</p>
<h2>Best practices in adopting either headless or composable commerce architecture</h2>
<p>There is no uniform IT playbook that’s specific to composable commerce vs. headless architecture. In general, though, you’ll want to:</p>
<h3>1. Plan based on reduced manual effort</h3>
<p>Greater agility should not come at the expense of increased time and effort from internal resources. While a headless CMS and a composable commerce platform can bring a lot of efficiencies, there can still be considerable integration and orchestration work involved. Look for a trusted partner with the experience and solutions that will ease the transition and set you up for greater flexibility in the long term.</p>
<h3>2. Expect a continued diversification of online shopping channels</h3>
<p>With more consumers using their smartphones to shop than ever before, you’ll need an eCommerce platform able to support advanced sales and marketing tools such as<a href="https://highstreet.io/local-inventory-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Local Inventory Ads (LIAs)</a>. At the same time, <a href="https://highstreet.io/managing-active-inventory-for-multiple-online-marketplaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more online marketplaces</a> are being introduced every year to target specific geographies or niche interests. Determine how, if you migrate to composable commerce, you can keep ahead of these new needs and channels.</p>
<h3>3. Keep your options open with APIs</h3>
<p>Your preferred architectural approach will lead to a more bespoke strategy based on your data, your maturity in managing product catalogs, existing CMS, and many other details. What you can be sure of, however, is that the need to sync APIs transcends the headless vs. composable commerce debate.</p>
<p>Decoupling the front and back end of your eCommerce website and embracing APIs, for instance, could be a starting point to introducing greater composability throughout your tech stack.</p>
<h3>4. Treat use cases as an opportunity to test and learn</h3>
<p>Even if you have specific eCommerce outcomes you’re trying to achieve, you should migrate to composable commerce or headless commerce with care. It’s not like flipping a switch.</p>
<p>A pilot project based on adding a single new digital channel could provide insight into what you’ll need to change or do differently. These learnings will make it easier as you standardize on a headless or composable commerce architecture. You’ll also be able to set more ambitious targets to maximize the potential of specific use cases.</p>
<h3>5. Think of continuous improvement as a metric</h3>
<p>Brands always want to do better in terms of serving their customers, but they don’t always measure it.</p>
<p>If you migrate to composable commerce, you can use cost, time to execute, and degree of internal efforts as part of a more holistic continuous improvement metric. In other words, resolving the headless vs. composable commerce debate is really about overcoming the rigidity of traditional eCommerce architecture.</p>
<h2>Why does composable commerce matter?</h2>
<p>Online shopping is only going to get more competitive, just as customer expectations are only going to rise.</p>
<p>A composable commerce platform gives you a foundation to address both of those business issues at once, especially when you have help to get you there.</p>
<p>Highstreet.io, for example, can play a pivotal role as you migrate to composable commerce or headless commerce. Our product feed management and social commerce solutions are designed to<b> simplify integration with third-party marketplaces and digital channels.</b></p>
<p>On the other hand, the orchestration capabilities of Highstreet.io can<b> reduce the complexity of putting together different parts of a composable architecture instance.</b></p>
<p>In fact, Highstreet.io can be classified as a vertical composable commerce platform because our solutions are wholly focused on commerce channels, rather than integrations pertaining to systems such as the PIM or ERP.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know what to do when we see the long, thin box on the front of Google’s home page: enter a brand name or a product category to help its search engine take us on the next step of a shopping journey.</p>
<p>As omnichannel marketing and selling become more sophisticated, however, many of us will soon be keeping our eyes open for brands that offer another option: visual search.</p>
<h2>What is Visual Search?</h2>
<p>Rather than typing in text to a search engine or using a voice assistant to make a query, visual search involves uploading or somehow adding an image to browse for answers online.</p>
<p>The formats for visual searches could include a photo that shoppers have taken while browsing the aisles or racks of a physical store or a screenshot they’ve taken from a website, among others. Once they’ve done so, the experience is much like that of a traditional Google search, where they see similar items to whatever appears in the image and links back to the source of the content.</p>
<h2>Launching a visual search eCommerce strategy</h2>
<p>Though your use of visual search will depend in part on the products you’re selling and the needs of your customer base, the following steps are a great way to get started:</p>
<h3>1. Identify visual search examples that align with your brand</h3>
<p>Though it may be less familiar than other forms of browsing the Web, several visual search tools are already widely available to consumers.<a href="https://lens.google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google Lens</a>, for instance, uses artificial intelligence such as machine learning to identify objects, translate text, and look for information by pointing your smartphone camera at an object like a dress or piece of furniture.</p>
<p>Depending on the image it’s scanning, Google Lens can take shoppers directly to a brand’s eCommerce website or a third-party online marketplace that contains inventory matching what’s being shown.</p>
<p>Microsoft has also moved into the visual search arena by<a href="https://searchengineland.com/visual-search-now-live-in-bing-chat-429527" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> adding features to Bing Chat</a>. This means that when customers land on a site that uses it, a Bing visual search feature will allow people to upload images as part of the “dialogue” they have with the chatbot to streamline the process of getting the response they want.</p>
<p>There is a Pinterest visual search option as well.<a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/article/pinterest-lens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Pinterest Lens</a> works by simply tapping the camera icon on its app, pinching or zooming in to an object, pressing a button, and then exploring anything similar that’s been published on other boards.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-16318 size-full" title="Pinterest visual search" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pinterest2.jpg" alt="Pinterest visual search" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pinterest2.jpg 1200w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pinterest2-980x653.jpg 980w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pinterest2-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Even Apple has made sure to incorporate visual search tools into its<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/21/vision-pro-visual-search-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Vision Pro headset</a>, which complements similar capabilities on the iPhone and iPad.</p>
<h3>2. Make a business case for visual search tools based on human behavior</h3>
<p>The connection between online search and visual data is nothing new. Consider the fact that since launching more than 20 years ago, Google Images now accounts for 10% of the company’s daily search traffic.</p>
<p>Research has found that<a href="https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/bid/350326/studies-confirm-the-power-of-visuals-in-elearning" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> visual information makes up 90% of what’s transmitted in the brain</a>, perhaps because 40% of nerve fibers are linked to our eyes’ retinas. That could explain why we can get a sense of what’s going on in an image in less than 1/10 of a second.</p>
<p>You only have to scroll through TikTok or Instagram to see how emphasizing visuals has transformed social media, which are among the top channels for trying to reach younger demographics. No wonder eMarketer published data in 2022 showing<a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/younger-shoppers-trying-visual-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> that 30% of U.S. adults aged 34 and younger have used visual search for shopping</a>, and 12% were already using it regularly.</p>
<h3>3. Study the brands that are already using visual search</h3>
<p>If you’re still not sure that providing customers with visual search tools is a priority, just look at some of the leading brands that have already moved forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/16/grokstyles-visual-search-tech-makes-it-into-ikeas-place-ar-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA</a>, for instance, has integrated visual search into its app, enhancing the augmented reality experience that allows consumers to create interior designs from wherever they are. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kaleighmoore/2019/09/04/why-more-retail-brands-are-launching-visual-search-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glasses USA</a> has done something similar with a tool called “Pic and Pair” to help consumers find the best designer frames for their faces.</p>
<p><a href="https://press.nordstrom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/12-things-you-didnt-know-about-nordstrom-and-nordstrom-rack-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nordstrom</a>, meanwhile, has been offering visual search eCommerce for several years, and<a href="https://www.aboutwayfair.com/tech-innovation/object-detection-and-visual-search-improvements" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> W</a>ayfair makes it easy to use images as part of its search experience as well.</p>
<h3>4. Check which online marketplaces are offering visual search eCommerce</h3>
<p>Shoppers are not only depending on using images when they land on a brand’s eCommerce site but when they’re looking to<a href="https://highstreet.io/top-online-marketplaces-for-fashion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> promote products on third-party online marketplaces</a> as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.asos.com/us/customer-care/product-stock/how-does-your-style-match-feature-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asos</a>, for instance, has made it easy for online shoppers to upload an image of a piece of clothing they like to its marketplace app and serve up recommended items directly from its product catalog. Amazon is also at the forefront with its<a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/resource-center/amazon-influencers-introducing-stylesnap" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Shop The Look</a> software to shop for clothes and accessories.</p>
<h3>5. Craft compelling images to make the most of visual search tools</h3>
<p>Once you’ve understood the technology and recognized where your products can be found using visual search, you’ll need to ensure you have the right content to make the most of it. The art of developing product visuals that will work well with emerging search technologies isn’t rocket science. It follows many of the same best practices that brands may already have adopted when they learned about<a href="https://highstreet.io/facebook-and-google-ads-image-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> image optimization</a> as part of creating Google Shopping Ads.</p>
<p>To drive more conversions, for example, you’ll want to stick with clutter-free images in common formats like JPEG or TIFF. You should also pay attention to the structure of URLs, and sizing and ensure you’re showing products in use.</p>
<h2>Building an effective and successfull Social Commerce Strategy</h2>
<p>Using visuals to drive sales is all part of<a href="https://highstreet.io/product-feed-management/social-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> turning your social channels into a shoppable storefront</a>. This can be a powerful strategy whether your brand is<a href="https://highstreet.io/how-to-create-snapchat-product-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> promoting products on Snapchat</a> or similar platforms. The important thing is to ensure you have a technology partner who can help <b>customize your product feed data to each channel</b>, manage your catalogs and inventory data, and monitor product performance.</p>
<p>This is where Highstreet.io can help – social commerce is just part of the solutions we offer to some of the world’s most successful fashion and luxury brands. Another example of meeting customers where they are is being present on the most relevant online marketplaces. That’s why it’s critical to have partner experiences in integrating products across multiple marketplaces while ensuring accurate and up-to-date inventory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even with an unlimited shopping budget, no one would order a complete wardrobe of luxury goods that they would have to wear for the rest of their lives. Styles change, personal preferences evolve and some clothing and accessories wear out and need to be replaced. Instead, we assemble our wardrobes and bring new pieces in and out as required – similar to the way MACH architecture is changing how brands are starting to look at the tech stack powering their eCommerce capabilities.</p>
<p>A few years ago, marketing research firm Gartner described this as a shift to <a href="https://www.gartner.ca/en/articles/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a composable enterprise</a>, where organizations would adopt technology like a series of interchangeable building blocks. This would lead to greater speed, flexibility, and resilience, its analysts said.<br />
Achieving composability as a business may sound like a lofty goal, which is why the MACH architecture brings together all the principles that you can keep in mind to ensure you’re choosing the right solutions along the way.</p>
<h2>What is MACH architecture?</h2>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/tip/A-quick-intro-to-the-MACH-architecture-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MACH architecture backgrounder</a> on TechTarget noted, MACH is more of a concept that businesses should use to develop a strategy rather than a one-size-fits-all blueprint.<br />
The four principles include:</p>
<h3>Microservices-based</h3>
<p>No one wants to encounter the “domino effect” in software, where you touch one piece of an application and it affects every other part. Microservices avoids this by treating each application function on an individual basis. That makes it easier to update, enhance or remove specific services more readily than you could with monolithic applications.</p>
<h3>API-first</h3>
<p>For a long time, internal development teams within organizations or those within vendor companies would begin writing code and even launch applications, then realize their work wasn’t done. They might need to integrate with other tools or add some kind of enhancements. This often leads to a search for the right application programming interface (API). An API-first approach puts the horse before the cart, understanding that starting with APIs will give them more options later on.</p>
<h3>Cloud-native</h3>
<p>Similarly, many applications that were initially developed to be installed on a company’s own premises have been revamped over the past number of years to run in the cloud. This includes many CRM systems, ERPs, and marketing software tools. Today, <a href="https://highstreet.io/saas-integration-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the advantages of a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model</a> have led to a cloud-native approach, where applications take full advantage of the elasticity, scale, and resilience of public, private, and hybrid cloud environments.</p>
<h3>Headless</h3>
<p>When many brands set up their first eCommerce sites, they were limited by content management systems that forced them to stick with the user interface (UI) that came with it. Today they have more options, thanks to headless commerce tools that decouple components like the UI from the back end where product data and other information are stored. This has eased the path for rendering content across mobile devices, wearables, and even “smart mirrors” in their store locations.</p>
<h2>MACH architecture example</h2>
<p>Several well-known brands are already demonstrating compelling MACH architecture example use cases. As Diginomica reported, pet food giant <a href="https://diginomica.com/mach-two-enterprise-adoption-learnings-mars-ikea-asics-interflora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mars Inc., furniture retailer Ikea, and Interflora are all moving to MACH solutions</a> to improve the way they operate.</p>
<p>The article also profiled footwear brand ASICS, which sees MACH as a way of providing richer product data, such as details on how many of its running shoes have information about heel drops. Focusing on MACH principles is allowing the company to deploy solutions that will surface more of what customers want to know amid omnichannel shopping experiences.</p>
<h2>MACH architecture pros and cons</h2>
<p>Companies don’t change the way they adopt IT very often, and there can be an understandable reluctance to upgrade or migrate to solutions that aren’t fully mature. Deciding on whether MACH architecture is right for you will come down to weighing the following:</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<p><b>Greater uptime</b><br />
Having an application crash or lag can have a detrimental impact on the business, particularly when you’re trying to sell to customers online. MACH solutions can help avoid this scenario because microservices, for instance, allow for greater fault isolation. That means pieces of an application can be remedied before a problem cascades to the rest. A brand’s digital presence can have higher availability as a result.</p>
<p><b>Faster upgrades</b><br />
Brands may often be interested in bringing on new tools to assist with their sales, marketing, and online orders, but need to check first that solutions will mesh with what they already have in place. The composable nature of MACH solutions provides a more streamlined and accelerated path to integrating with a greater variety of applications and tools. This in turn could help brands gain a competitive advantage or speed up the time to market with features that customers want from a digital experience.</p>
<p><b>Scaleable growth</b><br />
More customers, more orders, a greater mix of inventory – nothing should get in the way of brands increasing the rate at which they achieve their business goals. When IT can’t deal with large volumes of data or creates other impediments, it’s obviously not going to provide the expected return on investment. Opting for MACH solutions could provide peace of mind that they can grow at an exponential level without significant risk their IT will fail to keep up.</p>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<p><b>Lack of expertise</b><br />
Many brands may not employ enough (or any) in-house developers who can create their own bespoke MACH architecture. This can be mitigated by working with trusted technology partners that have already developed their solutions based on MACH principles</p>
<p><b>More tools</b><br />
MACH solutions that are developed or deployed internally may require additional tools to monitor and manage their performance. In other cases, however, SaaS tools will have measurement and reporting capabilities built into the core product</p>
<p><b>Legacy issues</b><br />
Moving to MACH solutions could involve retiring older, monolithic applications that have been in place for some time. Rather than seeing this as a project calling for a complete revamp of your entire tech stack, look for specific areas where deploying a MACH solution will bring business value while putting you on the road to composability.</p>
<h2>Selecting MACH Solutions</h2>
<p>The criteria for what you need in a MACH architecture will depend on your business and its needs, but aim to cover these bases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose-built</strong>: You want best-of-breed building blocks that were designed with specific business outcomes in mind versus more generic, all-purpose solutions</li>
<li><strong>Pre-built integrations</strong>: APIs and webhooks should make it easy to bring on applications and tools without causing significant business disruption</li>
<li><strong>Strong SLAs</strong>: The most trusted SaaS solutions include service-level agreements that let you move forward with confidence</li>
<li><strong>Continuous delivery model</strong>: Automatic updates eliminate the risk of solutions becoming out of date or creating vulnerabilities</li>
<li><strong>Access to expertise</strong>: Look beyond the solution itself and establish that you’re working with a company whose team can guide your shift towards a MACH architecture</li>
</ul>
<h2>MACH solutions for eCommerce</h2>
<p>For areas such as <a href="https://highstreet.io/product-feed-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product feed management</a>, <a href="https://highstreet.io/marketplace-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketplace integration</a>, and <a href="https://highstreet.io/marketplace-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local inventory ads</a>, Highstreet.io offers an example of MACH architecture in action.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When your business is primarily focused on physical stores, you might have locations with top addresses such as “New York, NY” or “Miami, Fla.” As more brands discover the critical importance of eCommerce as a sales channel, however, the most viable location might simply be “online marketplace, USA.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/us-retail-ecommerce-marketplaces-forecast-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data collected by eMarketer</a>, for example, USA marketplaces will grow by more than 10% in 2023 to nearly $385 billion. This represents more than a third of total retail eCommerce sales. That trend is expected to continue over the next five years when the rate of U.S. marketplace growth will surpass 12%.</p>
<p>Expanding sales into online marketplaces in the USA can help you reach a broader audience, increase product visibility, and significantly improve your sales.</p>
<p>While many brands are already familiar with the biggest USA marketplace players, it pays to do your research. Depending on how you set up your products and promote them, there’s a whole world of untapped potential to reach consumers who might never have discovered your brand otherwise.</p>
<h2>Online Marketplaces in the USA: The Top Choices</h2>
<p>The growth of online marketplaces in the USA continues unabated, accompanied by increasing competition. The oversaturation of retailers within these marketplaces presents formidable barriers to overcome.<br />
That&#8217;s why many retailers and distributors have taken matters into their own hands by establishing their own USA marketplaces. This initiative has enabled them to reduce shipping costs, streamline product assortment processes, and strengthen supplier relationships.</p>
<p>One major benefit of this strategy is the consolidation of multiple product options, providing customers with a <strong>single eCommerce destination and a simpler, unified shopping experience.</strong><br />
Let&#8217;s delve into some of the top online marketplace options in the US where you can start selling your products, and explore how a marketplace integrator can streamline the integration process.</p>
<h3><b>Amazon</b></h3>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16152 size-full" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amazon-screen.jpg" alt="Amazon marketplace" width="750" height="376" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amazon-screen.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amazon-screen-480x241.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /><b></b></h3>
<p>Amazon Marketplace U.S. is not only the most recognized U.S. marketplace but boasts <a href="https://amzscout.net/blog/amazon-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the industry’s biggest numbers</a>. These include 310 million active users (80% of whom are based in the U.S.), an estimated two billion web visitors a month, and more than 600 million products.</p>
<p>On the flip side, there are also more than two million sellers already using Amazon as an eCommerce channel, and about 1.1 million of them are specifically using the company’s online marketplace in the USA.</p>
<p>Selling on Amazon generally happens in several ways. Traditionally, sellers could opt for the <b>Vendor Central</b> or wholesale approach, where products are sold in bulk to Amazon. While this is a straightforward way to get your products listed, it means you’re losing any control over the final price of customer lists.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fulfillment by Merchant (FBM)</b> means you’ll handle logistics and delivery yourself. You’ll either need to have strong in-house logistics capabilities or another partner that can meet the requirements of Amazon’s service levels. These include selling products on time, an order cancellation rate of less than .5%, and adherence to Amazon’s return policy. FBM means fewer Amazon fees and more control over your inventory, but also greater responsibility and focus on getting products to customers rather than marketing and selling to them.</li>
<li><b>Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA)</b>, on the other hand, means the company will not only list your products in its USA marketplace but handle storing, picking, packing, and shipping your products. Choosing FBA means you benefit from Amazon Prime shipping rates, can have products featured on the Buy Box where customers see “Add to Cart” or “Buy Now” and Amazon’s customer service capabilities. The downside? There are fees associated with this, of course, so calculate your return on investment (ROI) for both options before deciding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon sells many of the products in its marketplace itself, of course, which means you have to approach it strategically.</p>
<p><b>Some best practices include: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Enroll in the<a href="https://brandservices.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Amazon brand registry</a>, which offers tools to protect your intellectual property and improve your customer experience</li>
<li>Once you’ve enrolled in the registry, explore tools such as Amazon A+ Content (previously known as Enhanced Brand Content or EBC), which allows you to include additional product information and images to your listing and make them more compelling for eCommerce shoppers</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers/zgbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monitor Amazon best sellers</a> to see which products might be trending and whether or not that will affect your eCommerce strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>eBay</b></h3>
<h2><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16157 size-full" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ebay-screen.jpg" alt="ebay marketplace" width="750" height="376" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ebay-screen.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ebay-screen-480x241.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></h2>
<p>With 133 million active users, eBay is another of the online marketplace USA giants. It’s also a good example of how online shopping behavior is shifting from desktops to smartphones. In fact, <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2023/06/ebay-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">58% of sales on eBay’s U.S. marketplace happen on mobile devices</a>. The company also boasts 18 million sellers, which range from everyday consumers getting rid of junk in their attics to sizable retail brands.</p>
<p>Selling on eBay’s U.S. marketplace means bearing in mind the various fees that are associated with the process. This includes insertion fees for listing products, “final value” fees once a product sells, and optional fees to upgrade listings such as bold fonts, subtitles, and a minimum/reserve price.</p>
<p>To sell on eBay, you’ll have to adopt its proprietary <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sellercenter/payments-and-fees/payments-and-earnings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managed payments system</a>, where revenue payouts can be scheduled or made on demand.</p>
<p>Like all major USA marketplaces, eBay continually tries to improve the seller experience. Some of the most recent updates include <a href="https://www.ebay.ca/sellercentre/resources/seller-updates/2023-summer/business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tools to resolve payment disputes and block inappropriate messages</a>, for example, as well as <a href="https://www.ebay.ca/sellercentre/resources/seller-updates/2023-summer/listing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dynamic ad rates for promoted listings and ad rate forecasts</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/static/inventory/matching-products.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Integrating </a>with eBay’s USA online marketplace can work as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have your developers choose <b>eBay’s Inventory API or Trading API</b> to create or revise a product listing and match your product to those in the eBay catalog</li>
<li>Include whatever product details are necessary based on the eBay product category. Common attributes of all categories include <b>Titles, Identifiers, Descriptions, Product Aspects, and Stock Photos</b>.</li>
<li>Use a search call within the <b>Catalog API</b> to find products that match those within your online inventory.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b style="font-size: 22px;">Walmart Marketplace</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16156 size-full" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wallmart-screen.jpg" alt="Selling on walmart marketplace" width="750" height="376" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wallmart-screen.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wallmart-screen-480x241.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It may be best known for its vast physical store locations, but Walmart’s online capabilities have made it a huge eCommerce destination as well. In its most recent <a href="https://marketplace.walmart.com/2023-playbook-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seller playbook</a>, Walmart said sellers on its online USA marketplace have seen gross merchandise value (GSV) skyrocket by an average of 50%. This could be because 85% of Walmart customers make at least one online purchase a month, according to the company.</p>
<p>Walmart tries to help brands on its online USA marketplace stand out through Sponsored Search Ads, and like Amazon, it offers fulfillment services to handle many of the common post-purchase chores.</p>
<p>Since it works on a commission basis, <a href="https://marketplace.walmart.com/about-walmart-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart Marketplace</a> doesn’t charge initial setup or monthly/annual fees. It also offers what it describes as lucrative referral fees. The bar for getting on board as a seller is higher, however. Its criteria include a demonstrated “history of the marketplace of eCommerce success,” a catalog that complies with its prohibited products policy, and proof you’re working with a B2C warehouse if you don’t use Walmart’s fulfillment services.</p>
<p>Integrating with Walmart Marketplace can take a few forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <b>a third-party online marketplace USA solution provider</b>, a selection of which Walmart has curated on its marketplace site</li>
<li>Manually <b>search for Walmart’s Item Management APIs</b> and have your internal developers test with the provided XML Schema Definition in Walmart’s API sandbox<br />
.</li>
<li>Set up a profile on Walmart’s online Seller Center and try using <b>Setup By Match, Single Item, or Bulk Upload Setup</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Target Plus™</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16155 size-full" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/target-plus-screen.jpg" alt="Target plus marketplace" width="750" height="376" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/target-plus-screen.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/target-plus-screen-480x241.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://plus.target.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Target Plus™</b></a> operates as an invite-only marketplace, making it an exclusive space for carefully vetted brands and retailers. By being part of it, you have access to a wide audience of online shoppers without having to worry about the burdensome competition that a brand would experience with other marketplaces like Amazon. As of 2023, <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/targets-curated-marketplace-turns-four" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target’s U.S. marketplace</a> has only about 650 sellers, which may make it less competitive than other platforms. Target also enjoys 200 million visits a month on its site, which represents a sizable customer base.</p>
<p>This is an invite-only platform, which means you have the added benefit of SKU exclusivity, allowing a more strategic product assortment for the most value.</p>
<p>Integration with Target Plus™ platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Use FTP or API to upload your products.</b><b><br />
</b>A third-party integrator can manage product and inventory updates, as well as Target Plus™ product orders, to seamlessly and effortlessly connect you with its default marketplace side integrator.</li>
</ul>
<p>What you’ll get?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Reduced backorders and oversold items</b><b><br />
</b>Some third-party integrators have marketplace inventory rules that can help reduce backorders and overselling issues.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Improved reach with a credible brand</b><b><br />
</b>Additional capabilities improve customers’ ability to find your products, and increase overall exposure and reach while reaping the benefit of being backed by a credible and established American brand name and identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Belk</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16154 size-full" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/belck-screen.jpg" alt="Belk marketpalce" width="750" height="376" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/belck-screen.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/belck-screen-480x241.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.belk.com/customer-service/policies-guidelines/vendor-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Belk</b></a> is an established, popular chain of department stores throughout the US that offers apparel, cosmetics, and home goods, and garners over $4 billion in annual revenue. As of 2023 it also sits at No. 7 for eCommerce an online marketplace USA ranking, with <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/belk.com/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15.2 million estimated monthly visits</a>. With these figures, it’s easy to understand how beneficial it can be to integrate with this marketplace.</p>
<p>Integration with Belk:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Product listings</b><b><br />
</b>When integrating with Belk, you are required to submit your products in the form of an Excel file. Alternatively, you can use a third-party integrator to list your products, in the format of your preference. Their platform will generate the required Excel file and submit it on your behalf, saving you plenty of time in the process.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Order shipment requirements</b><b><br />
</b>Belk is known to have strict order shipment requirements; If a shipment is not made on time, you will be penalized. When you submit order shipment data to a third-party integration platform, and if you have multiple marketplace integrations, the shipment data can easily be scaled – providing a uniform and consistent shipment language across multiple marketplaces at once.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Order side synchronization</b><b><br />
</b>Thanks to its versatile transformations, some integration solutions can make order-side synchronization highly effective and simple, being able to use multiple file formats, including XML through shared folders. With this feature, you don’t need to worry about exporting certain file types or working with unfamiliar formats, as the platform handles it all ensuring consistency throughout all communications.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Frequent product updates</b><b><br />
</b>Product data updates will take place as frequently as once a day, while inventory can be updated hourly, meaning you can rest assured knowing that your product listings are always up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Macy’s &amp; Bloomingdales</b></h3>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16153 size-full" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macys-screen.jpg" alt="marketplace by macy's" width="750" height="376" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macys-screen.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macys-screen-480x241.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.macysinc.com/vendors/vendor-opportunities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Macy’s and Bloomingdales</b></a> both have strong brand recognition and both focus on fashion apparel. These luxury department stores recognize the creativity in retailing and use their creativity to strengthen vendor relationships. Partnering with Macy’s and Bloomingdales means diversifying your customer base to include a loyal, prestigious clientele.</p>
<p>Retailers who offer luxury merchandise at competitive prices can greatly benefit from the <a href="https://highstreet.io/unlock-the-potential-of-macys-marketplace-with-integration-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>integration with Macy’s</b></a> and Bloomingdales.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Side integration</b><b><br />
</b>Macy’s and Bloomingdales use the same marketplace-side integration solution as Belk, which seamlessly integrates with multiple order management systems. Integration platforms can facilitate the entire data feed submission process, inventory update process, and every other aspect of the integration process on the back end by using any file format, including XML. This means more time saved on an otherwise manual process and the reassurance of having accurate product data</li>
<li><b>Frequent updates</b><b><br />
</b>Using standard data feeds, product data and inventory updates are done frequently and completely handled on the back-end, without the need to get you involved. Product listings are always up-to-date so that your customers are faced with the correct information during their shopping experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sell More Products with Marketplace Integration</h2>
