										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The definition of luxury changes when you move from the physical world to online shopping.</p>
<p>Consumers who go looking for luxury fashion in person can appreciate a well-designed space devoted exclusively to a single brand.</p>
<p>They might admire the tasteful décor that sets off the clothes to even greater effect.</p>
<p>An in-person luxury shopping experience also tends to be highly curated – in other words, retailers might only need to showcase their finest goods in order to appeal to discerning customers.</p>
<h2>Why you should sell through a luxury fashion marketplace</h2>
<p>The potential to grow revenues through digital channels requires luxury brands to rethink all of these principals and focus on an entirely different kind of experience.</p>
<p>The key priorities for eCommerce shoppers, including those focused on luxury fashion – are speed, convenience and accurate information.</p>
<p>Consumers expect to find the luxury brands they want instantly. They want as many options as possible in order to make the best choice. And when they’re considering a particular item, they need to feel confident that all the details – especially availability – is up to date.</p>
<p>This helps explain why elite brands are increasingly expanding their digital presence beyond their own web sites and featuring their products through luxury fashion marketplaces.</p>
<p>Far from losing any perception of prestige, adding products to a luxury fashion marketplace shows a brand recognizes that true luxury in eCommerce is all about making it easy to get what you want.</p>
<p>That said, luxury brands should still put the same care and attention into their presence within online marketplaces as they do setting up a physical location.</p>
<p>With the right approach to optimization, your brand will be:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li>Discovered by more consumers</li>
<li>Driving more conversions and revenue</li>
<li>Encourage repeat visits and positive word of mouth</li>
</ul>
<h2>Optimizing eCommerce for a luxury fashion marketplace</h2>
<p>The Internet is already a busy place, where it can be difficult for particular brands to stand out. A lot of the business you drive through your own website will depend on traffic you get through search engine optimization (SEO) and paid marketing tactics.</p>
<p>Joining a luxury fashion marketplace brings you into a more focused environment where consumers are looking for a wide range of brands to explore. However this also means you’ll want to differentiate yourself from other retailers selling within the same space.</p>
<h2>How luxury brands can stand out in an online marketplace</h2>
<p>If you operate physical stores, you probably thought carefully about how they were built and ensured they were easy to stroll through without getting lost. The same principle applies online.</p>
<h3>Introduce yourself (and reinforce your brand identity)</h3>
<p>Your logo is only one element that tells consumers who you are and why you represent a brand worth exploring.</p>
<p>Remember that some of those browsing a luxury marketplace may not be familiar with you at all. Make the best possible impression by including information such as a condensed version of your mission and any relevant details about your history and reputation.</p>
<p>Others may come on a luxury fashion marketplace hoping to find your brand included, and these details will reassure them the experience you’re offering will be consistent with what they’ve seen elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Let each product description tell a compelling story</h3>
<p>Offering basic details such as sizes, colors and pricing are just a starting point when you’re positioning your products through a luxury clothing marketplace.</p>
<p>Converting browsers into buyers is all about making them understand your brand’s unique approach to developing quality apparel and accessories. This can include the materials you use, the craftsmanship you apply and more.</p>
<p>The copywriting you do here can make the difference between attracting a customer who stays with you for life and one who chooses to browse another brand instead.</p>
<h3>Ensure every image offers maximum appeal</h3>
<p>You don’t always need ideal lighting when you’re selling products in a physical store because shoppers can touch and feel them directly. In a luxury clothing marketplace, pictures represent the most powerful way for you to convey the beauty and style of every item.</p>
<p>Choose images that not only provide a clear view of what you’re selling but create a sense of aspiration. This can mean showing products from different angles and incorporating lifestyle elements, such as a model wearing a product in an attractive everyday setting.</p>
<h3>Use data analytics to inform the most meaningful changes</h3>
<p>Retailers always keep a close eye on the number of products they sell, but being on a luxury marketplace can offer other data points that can help you continuously improve how you showcase your products.</p>
<p>Look for ways to measure the time spent on each product, shopping cart abandonment rates and anything specific provided by a marketplace operator to fine-tune your approach. The more data-driven you can be as a retailer, the more likely you’ll be able to reach or even exceed your eCommerce goals.</p>
<h2>The best luxury fashion marketplace options for premium brands</h2>
<p>Your sales strategy for luxury marketplaces can begin by identifying which platforms align best with your ideal customer profile and brand. In doing so you’ll also want to take into account the level of active users each platform offers, seller requirements and the options for handling shipping and returns.</p>
<p>Some brands start by integrating with a single luxury marketplace and taking a “test and learn” approach before adding others. Once you’ve learned what’s involved in getting set up – and when you have partners with the technologies to help automate the process – it can be easier to expand into other luxury clothing marketplaces over time.</p>
<p>Some of the most common platforms where other luxury brands are actively selling right now include:</p>
<h3>Zalando</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-18546" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Secrets-of-selling-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" /></p>
<p>It’s already one of Europe’s most popular online destinations for luxury fashion, but<a href="https://highstreet.io/zalando-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Zalando</a> is continuing to make changes that could strengthen its market position even further.</p>
<p>In early 2024, for example,<a href="https://internetretailing.net/zalando-targets-both-b2c-and-b2b-in-growth-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Zalando announced it is working to enrich some of its existing categories</a>, including Sports and Kids &amp; Family through technologies that will personalize the inspiration it provides. Tools like Zalando Assistant, meanwhile, is allowing commerce to become more conversational – almost akin to the expert help luxury brands have traditionally provided in-store through expert associates.</p>
<p><a href="https://fashionunited.uk/news/business/zalando-targets-a-larger-share-of-the-fashion-e-commerce-market-with-new-ecosystem/2024031374584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zalando has also said it is opening up its logistics infrastructure, software and service capabilities</a> to help retailers sell more effectively to customers.</p>
<h3>Asos</h3>
<p>Luxury clothing isn’t limited to new merchandise. Many shoppers go online looking for vintage collections and the latest collections at the same time. Asos has a marketplace that has been successful in both kinds of clothing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1252308/asos-marketplace-second-hand-apparel-online-shops-brand-profile-in-the-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brand awareness for the Asos marketplace is 65% in the U.K. alone</a>, and 80% of its customers tend to be loyal to the brand. That could mean a lot of return visits for luxury brands who feature products on the Asos marketplace.</p>
<p>In the meantime,<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/uks-asos-sinks-first-half-loss-names-dave-murray-cfo-2024-04-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Asos in early 2024 appointed a new CFO</a> whose eCommerce experience includes a stint at Amazon, suggesting Asos will become even more competitive in the fashion sector.</p>
<h3>Farfetch</h3>
<p>From the moment it launched in 2007,<a href="https://highstreet.io/integrazione-marketplace-farfetch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Farfetch</a> has been focused on acting as a trusted partner to brands that want to be included on the top global luxury fashion marketplace.</p>
<p>This means Farfetch doesn’t carry any inventory of its own but provides third-party services to help other luxury brands find sales success.</p>
<p>In early 2024,<a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2023/12/18/coupang-to-acquire-farfetch-assets-in-500-million-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Farfetch was acquired by South Korean eCommerce giant Coupang</a>, which said it would invest in helping the marketplace to further improve the customer experience for luxury shoppers around the world.</p>
<h2>Bet on the most sought-after luxury brands and increase sales</h2>
<p>The best sales strategy for luxury marketplaces always takes into account what other premium brands are doing online. Even as you begin uploading your products to the kinds of platforms we’ve just described, you should continue to monitor and assess competitors whose activities could provide insight on eCommerce best practices as they emerge.</p>
<p>Some of the parameters to keep in mind here:</p>
<h3>The most searched luxury brands online</h3>
<p><a href="https://us.fashionnetwork.com/news/Louis-vuitton-gucci-most-searched-for-luxury-brands-in-2023-according-to-google-data,1570517.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Dior are the “big three”</a> in terms of what consumers are keying into Google, according to recent data. Pay attention to the keywords these brands are using to rank in search results, and how you might weave them into your own copy.</p>
<h3>The most profitable luxury brands online</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/5-most-valuable-luxury-companies-in-the-world-1261298/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LVMH scores the top spot in this category as well</a>, followed by luxury brands such as Dior, Hermes and EssilorLuxottica, among others. While profitability is driven from many different facets, these brands represent the ideal in how they balance supply and demand as they serve style-conscious consumers</p>
<h3>The most in-demand luxury fashion brands online</h3>
<p>It may be a subjective area, but shopping app <a href="https://fashionista.com/2024/01/lyst-index-top-popular-brands-products-2023-q4-prada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyst’s most recent quarterly index</a> said Prada is the hottest luxury brand, followed by Miu Miu, Loewe and Bottega Veneta. Use this kind of ranking to consider the most creative approaches luxury brands can take in how they market themselves online as you prepare your product listings and images to upload onto online marketplaces.</p>
<h2>The most important luxury fashion marketplace best practice of all</h2>
<p>Luxury brands have to be good at many different things at once: designing products, creating compelling marketing content and providing outstanding customer service.</p>
<p>That means they shouldn’t be bogged down with the technical aspects of getting their products on a luxury clothing marketplace. Automating this process through a product feed management solution is the smartest move you can make as you prepare to boost your long-term eCommerce sales.<a href="https://highstreet.io/contact-us/"> Connect with us</a> to find out how we can assist with integration across more than 50 of the top marketplaces in the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every retailer renovates their stores occasionally, and they often go well beyond adding a fresh coat of paint.</p>
<p>The layout of the aisles may get reconfigured for easier browsing.</p>
<p>New displays and signage clarify where shoppers can find their favorite product categories.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale systems get moved and self-checkout kiosks are set up to streamline purchasing.</p>
<p>Even if they make major changes, though, brands are essentially working within the same three-dimensional space of four walls, a ceiling, and a floor.</p>
<p>An eCommerce renovation – even a minor one – is more complicated. That’s why the difference between composable commerce vs. headless approaches matters.</p>
<h2>What is the difference between composable commerce vs. headless?</h2>
<p>When brands set up their first eCommerce sites, they couldn’t have anticipated the way shoppers would not only browse on desktop PCs but also on their smartphones.</p>
<p>The same goes for social media platforms, which evolved from places to share content with friends and family to a showcase for all manner of fashion and luxury goods.</p>
<p>Who would have realized that brands could not only sell through their site but Amazon, Zalando, and even<a href="https://highstreet.io/unlock-the-potential-of-macys-marketplace-with-integration-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> online marketplaces from the likes of Macy’s</a>?</p>
<p><a href="https://highstreet.io/category/marketing-channels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Every new digital channel that emerges</a> represents a huge opportunity for brands. Think of each one as a new door that gets added to a physical store. In reality, however, adding those doors can prove daunting. Existing technology platforms can prove rigid or inflexible to integrate more channels.</p>
<p>If you’re weighing composable vs. headless options for the future of your eCommerce business, it’s probably because they each represent a more fluid and dynamic way to tackle these challenges. Here’s how to distinguish between the two:</p>
<h3>Headless architecture</h3>
<p>The design of an eCommerce site may vary largely among brands, but the underlying architecture is usually the same. There is a front end that customers see, usually based on a content management system (CMS) to display creative elements like images and text. There is also the back-end, which can handle everything from capturing and processing orders to feeding into a CRM and other systems.</p>
<p>The key characteristic of headless vs. composable commerce is that it essentially consists of decoupling or separating these two areas of functionality and using an API to facilitate communication from one to the other.</p>
<p>This allows the backend to continue running as it should while allowing brands to optimize the CMS to work with social media, wearables, and even VR/AR channels. It opens up the ability to create customer experiences based on particular personas, segments, or business models.</p>
<h3>Composable commerce architecture</h3>
<p>What sets composable commerce vs. headless, on the other hand, is an even greater ability to customize eCommerce experiences.</p>
<p>A composable commerce architecture uses microservices to treat functions as a series of modules.</p>
<p>When you migrate to composable commerce with the right partner solutions, for instance, it becomes far easier to orchestrate the connection between a brand’s product catalog, order management system, inventory management system, and ERP via that API.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16626" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Composable-commerce-arc.png" alt="Composable commerce architecture" width="750" height="996" /></p>
<p>Whether your business goal is to enhance ad retargeting, adopt a new social media service, or sell on an online marketplace, a composable commerce platform allows you to “compose” your tech stack without introducing performance or interoperability issues. Instead, those front-end customer touchpoints and back-end operations can be mixed and matched as required.</p>
<p>Just as fashionable consumers create a perfect ensemble by selecting the ideal top, shirt, shoes, and jewelry, a composable commerce architecture provides brands the freedom to curate the ideal tech stack.</p>
<h2>What are composable commerce vs. headless pros and cons?</h2>
<p>As you assess the potential headless and composable commerce benefits, keep in mind the following:</p>
<h3>Headless architecture pros:</h3>
<ul style="margin-left: 15px !important;">
<li>Faster time to deploying new eCommerce experiences such as smart mirrors and progressive web applications (PWAs)</li>
<li>More options in terms of the CMS used to adapt emerging digital channels</li>
<li>The ability to make changes to the CMS or backend without one negatively impacting the other.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Headless architecture cons:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Greater complexity and maintenance requirements based on potentially using more than one CMS</li>
<li>Greater costs to build eCommerce experiences specific to each digital channel</li>
<li>Platform limitations: Depending on your business needs there may not always be a large number of platforms that support headless commerce.</li>
<li>Potential API rate limits and GET request limits based on fetching multiple product catalogs to support multiple markets</li>
</ul>
<h3>Composable commerce architecture pros:</h3>
<ul style="margin-left: 15px !important;">
<li>The greatest possible range of features and vendor integrations to build into an eCommerce experience</li>
<li>Increased scalability of new features and channels as your business grows</li>
<li>A utilization model based on business need, reducing the risk of over-investing in technology</li>
<li>Increased speed to modify or make changes by substituting or upgrading specific modules without a negative impact on other modules or core systems</li>
</ul>
<h3>Composable commerce architecture cons:</h3>
<ul style="margin-left: 15px !important;">
<li>Potentially larger pool of vendor relationships to manage as additional microservices are added to the overall eCommerce experience</li>
<li>Greater onus on orchestrating microservices and modules without jeopardizing performance and security</li>
<li>Increased complexity in integrating with multiple online marketplaces in addition to a brand’s own eCommerce website.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Choosing between composable commerce vs. headless architecture</h2>
<p>Resolving the debate over headless vs. composable commerce should begin, as with any critical business decision, by looking at your current and future customer needs.</p>
<p>Use existing data about customer behavior to indicate how their digital habits are changing, and whether providing the best possible experience will require adding more channels. Complement this with market research that helps validate the shifts in customer journeys you’ve perceived.</p>
<p>Next, consider the impact of your eCommerce evolution on your team. A composable commerce platform or headless CMS, for example, could provide greater uptime, faster upgrades, and more manageable growth. This is the thinking behind what is now known as<a href="https://highstreet.io/mach-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> MACH principles</a>, where architecture is microservices-based, API-first, cloud-native, and headless.</p>
<h2>Best practices in adopting either headless or composable commerce architecture</h2>
<p>There is no uniform IT playbook that’s specific to composable commerce vs. headless architecture. In general, though, you’ll want to:</p>
<h3>1. Plan based on reduced manual effort</h3>
<p>Greater agility should not come at the expense of increased time and effort from internal resources. While a headless CMS and a composable commerce platform can bring a lot of efficiencies, there can still be considerable integration and orchestration work involved. Look for a trusted partner with the experience and solutions that will ease the transition and set you up for greater flexibility in the long term.</p>
<h3>2. Expect a continued diversification of online shopping channels</h3>
<p>With more consumers using their smartphones to shop than ever before, you’ll need an eCommerce platform able to support advanced sales and marketing tools such as<a href="https://highstreet.io/local-inventory-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Local Inventory Ads (LIAs)</a>. At the same time, <a href="https://highstreet.io/managing-active-inventory-for-multiple-online-marketplaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more online marketplaces</a> are being introduced every year to target specific geographies or niche interests. Determine how, if you migrate to composable commerce, you can keep ahead of these new needs and channels.</p>
<h3>3. Keep your options open with APIs</h3>
<p>Your preferred architectural approach will lead to a more bespoke strategy based on your data, your maturity in managing product catalogs, existing CMS, and many other details. What you can be sure of, however, is that the need to sync APIs transcends the headless vs. composable commerce debate.</p>
<p>Decoupling the front and back end of your eCommerce website and embracing APIs, for instance, could be a starting point to introducing greater composability throughout your tech stack.</p>
<h3>4. Treat use cases as an opportunity to test and learn</h3>
<p>Even if you have specific eCommerce outcomes you’re trying to achieve, you should migrate to composable commerce or headless commerce with care. It’s not like flipping a switch.</p>
<p>A pilot project based on adding a single new digital channel could provide insight into what you’ll need to change or do differently. These learnings will make it easier as you standardize on a headless or composable commerce architecture. You’ll also be able to set more ambitious targets to maximize the potential of specific use cases.</p>
<h3>5. Think of continuous improvement as a metric</h3>
<p>Brands always want to do better in terms of serving their customers, but they don’t always measure it.</p>
<p>If you migrate to composable commerce, you can use cost, time to execute, and degree of internal efforts as part of a more holistic continuous improvement metric. In other words, resolving the headless vs. composable commerce debate is really about overcoming the rigidity of traditional eCommerce architecture.</p>
<h2>Why does composable commerce matter?</h2>
<p>Online shopping is only going to get more competitive, just as customer expectations are only going to rise.</p>
<p>A composable commerce platform gives you a foundation to address both of those business issues at once, especially when you have help to get you there.</p>
<p>Highstreet.io, for example, can play a pivotal role as you migrate to composable commerce or headless commerce. Our product feed management and social commerce solutions are designed to<b> simplify integration with third-party marketplaces and digital channels.</b></p>
<p>On the other hand, the orchestration capabilities of Highstreet.io can<b> reduce the complexity of putting together different parts of a composable architecture instance.</b></p>
<p>In fact, Highstreet.io can be classified as a vertical composable commerce platform because our solutions are wholly focused on commerce channels, rather than integrations pertaining to systems such as the PIM or ERP.</p>

<p>Years ago, one sure sign of a brand’s success was its products being featured on the shelves of an ever-growing number of retailers and department stores. Today, success is about finding a brand while browsing the online marketplace of your choice – and trusting that you can order the products you need based on active inventory data without having to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Brands understand this, but expanding through digital channels presents a different set of challenges than setting up physical locations or adding more retail and wholesale partners.</p>
<p>First, there is no shortage of online marketplaces to choose from. Besides familiar names like Amazon or Zalando, retailers ranging from <a href="https://highstreet.io/unlock-the-potential-of-macys-marketplace-with-integration-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macy&#8217;s and Bloomingdales</a> to Belk and <a href="https://highstreet.io/online-marketplaces-usa-expand-ecommerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others </a>are all actively working with third-party sellers. More than likely, growing brands will want to be present across many marketplaces at once to achieve their eCommerce revenue targets.</p>

<h2>Why inventory data is critical to online marketplace success</h2>
<p>Ensuring a great customer experience across multiple channels relies on sending the correct stock data to each marketplace, enabling consumers to see what&#8217;s available for purchase. Accurate pricing and inventory information are just as crucial as presenting product features and an appealing image.</p>
<p>This is why many brands seek out <a href="https://highstreet.io/multi-marketplace-integration-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketplace integration services</a> in the first place, though their needs could evolve significantly as they continue to expand.</p>
<p>Initially, a brand might update product feeds from a central warehouse hourly during the day and every few hours at night, depending on its location. Concurrently, historical sales data could determine the percentage of stock to distribute to each marketplace.</p>
<p>In practice, sales can unexpectedly fluctuate based on shifts in demand from one online marketplace to another. The existing cadence of product feed updates may not keep pace with purchases, increasing order cancellations. This not only impacts customer experience but also jeopardizes relationships with online marketplaces that base seller agreements on minimizing cancellation rates.</p>
<h2>Innovation that addresses active inventory management</h2>
<p>Highstreet.io recently developed a real-time system to address these challenges. It allows brands to <b>dynamically manage active inventory across multiple marketplaces at once</b>. This involved changing the architecture of our existing solutions to adjust the way data is handled once a product had been ordered, but not yet fulfilled.</p>
<p>The functionality Highstreet.io built introduces a series of dedicated “buckets” that <b>manage inventory data in both physical and virtual warehouses</b>, as well as a component that can calculate how inventory should be distributed based upon pre-defined business rules. Incremental orders could be “reserved” as they are created, for example, but the system also tracks when they were canceled or when the system needs to be reset.</p>
<p>Brands also need to store inventory values once orders have been distributed, of course, and Highstreet.io’s active inventory solution added that too. It also includes a module to configure the flow of inventory data across channels and a way to visualize a brand’s inventory by marketplace and SKU, as well as the history of all updates from a brand’s product feeds.</p>
<h2>The benefits of enhancing your ability to manage active inventory</h2>
<h3>1. Reduce your cancellation rate</h3>
<p>Highstreet.io’s active inventory solution will provide brands greater confidence that their customers will be able to find the products they want, regardless of the online marketplaces where they choose to shop. This also helps build a <b>track record for increased accuracy</b>, which allows brands to meet the key performance indicators of their marketplace partners.</p>
<h3>2. Complete automation of a complex process</h3>
<p>By calculating the precise stock value that gets sent to each marketplace, Highstreet.io’s active inventory solution will also save brands from having to conduct a manual, historical analysis of which orders were canceled or the rate of cancellation.</p>
<h3>3. Gain insight into sales performance across multiple online marketplaces</h3>
<p>While the technology handles the heavy lifting, brands need to maintain clear visibility into the health of their business at all times. That’s why <strong>Highstreet.io&#8217;s active inventory solution</strong> also provides reporting on the state of its inventory, orders, and SKUs. These reports are emailed to simplify distribution to all relevant stakeholders, empowering them to make informed decisions about the evolution of their sales and marketing strategy.</p>
<h3>4. Ease of expansion to into additional online marketplaces</h3>
<p>With more third parties opening up platforms for sellers, it will not be unusual for brands to make their products available across a wide range of partners. They will now be in a better position to do so, knowing thanks to the ability to <b>dynamically synchronize pricing and inventory data across all shopping channels.</b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As peak shopping periods like Black Friday get closer, there is no time to waste. This is the time you should start looking at your big-ticket items and consider how best to promote them.<br />
It’s when you develop ad campaigns with creative visuals that showcase your most attractive offers. And if you’re serious about having a successful Black Friday, it’s the moment you optimize your Amazon product data feed, too.</p>
<p>While the company sells plenty of its own merchandise to eCommerce buyers, for example, as many as<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/259782/third-party-seller-share-of-amazon-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 60% of paid units are sold on Amazon by third-party merchants</a> across a wide range of categories.</p>
<p>The size of the marketplace indeed means there is plenty of competition on Amazon. However, the company continues to offer innovations that help other brands stand out. This includes<a href="https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/digital-commerce/amazon-inspire-shoppable-content-feed-discovery-immersive-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the “Inspire” feed</a> introduced in late 2022, as well as<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/14/amazon-updates-visual-search-ar-search-and-more-in-challenge-to-google/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAopAwc6S05QqiF6tx59ynRjjeBUlHoZxgFVPDyh7Z9mgcElKZRbY3YbWanzF3xmDZjmX5PvqKyyOE3zAUqBg_qbytNeeGsx5BySP_4MBE3vVukgpOzDzzzYkZlHa9p33petYoOtCAfbVhfMvhGna2gOJ-UleoqYW23WcOSPRIXr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> product discovery tools</a> based on augmented reality and<a href="https://highstreet.io/using-visual-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> visual search</a>.</p>
<h2>How to better list your products on Amazon Marketplace</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16372" title="Listing Products on Amazon Marketplace" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/amazon-list.jpg" alt="Products on Amazon Marketplace" width="750" height="500" /></p>
<p>Much like other online marketplaces,<a href="https://highstreet.io/amazon-product-listings-all-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> getting products listed on Amazon</a> involves some basic steps.</p>
<p>You’ll need to choose the appropriate product category,<a href="https://highstreet.io/your-ultimate-guide-to-amazon-pricing-strategy-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> determine your pricing strategy</a>, select a<a href="https://highstreet.io/amazon-fba-inventory-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> fulfillment</a> method, and use keywords Amazon visitors will likely key into the search bar.</p>
<p>Some of these steps will involve some manual effort, but to scale effectively and maximize your eCommerce sales opportunities, you’ll also want to harness the power of automation for your Amazon product data feeds.</p>
<h2>Benefits of having an optimized Amazon product data feed</h2>
<p>Amazon’s marketplace customers have the same expectations as those who discover your brand through your website or any other channel. They want to see accurate product listings, up to date, and reflect what’s available for purchase.</p>
<p>As you begin to list more products on Amazon, however, maintaining the quality of your data can become incredibly difficult. Updating pricing, available inventory, and other aspects of hundreds of listings or more isn’t a great use of employees’ time.</p>
<p>Beyond taking those chores away, the benefits of automating your Amazon product data feeds include:</p>
<h3>1. Listings that do your products justice</h3>
<p>When consumers walk into a physical store, you only get one chance to make a first impression. That’s why retailers often put out their best products on a table or rack where discerning customers can notice all the key details.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to online product listings. Your Amazon product data feed should be optimized to ensure you’re providing everything from product titles, descriptions, and images that convert visitors into buyers.</p>
<h3>2. Product information customers can trust</h3>
<p>Without automation, an Amazon product data feed might only be updated once every few days. That poses a risk that customers will not realize the price of an item they’re considering has changed, or that it’s temporarily out of stock.</p>
<p>Your goal should be to provide real-time updates that reflect the current state of every product in your inventory. That way, you can more easily offer promotions and discounts that drive more activity during periods like Black Friday.</p>
<h3>3. Can’t-miss visibility in Amazon search results</h3>
<p>Much like when they’re looking up information on Google, many consumers probably don’t want to go past the first page of results when they’re searching on Amazon.</p>
<p>When you put in the work upfront to research the right keywords, an Amazon product data feed will maximize the likelihood your items will rank higher than competitors. And of course, with its one-click buy button, Amazon makes it easy for customers to take the next step when they find what they want.</p>
<h3>4. Access to a global market</h3>
<p>Unlike the limitations of a physical storefront, eCommerce allows sellers to transcend borders and other geographic boundaries. This is especially true on Amazon, which enjoys<a href="https://www.blankspace.eu/blog-posts-en/amazon-marketplaces-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> billions in sales in markets such as the U.K., Germany, and Japan</a>.</p>
<p>No matter where they’re based, though, your customers should have a consistent experience in terms of the level of detail and timeliness of the data in your listings. Automating your product feed on Amazon will ensure that, even if the same customer decides to browse across more than one Amazon regional site.</p>
<h3>5. An end to constant inventory worries</h3>
<p>It may sound like a nice problem to have, but when a product proves more popular than expected there can be more disappointed customers than those feeling satisfied. Running out of stock can hurt your reputation as a brand, both with customers and Amazon itself (more on that later in this post).</p>
<p>Think of your product data feed as a trusted assistant who makes managing inventory levels both easy and efficient. Stock getting low? You can set an alert to be notified and take action before it’s too late.</p>
<h3>6. Out-price the competition</h3>
<p>Depending on the product category, there may be little to truly differentiate your brand from your rivals, other than what you’re asking customers to pay.</p>
<p>Instead of treating this as a race to the bottom in terms of revenue, however, you can use Amazon’s Repricing tool or your analytics to determine what will make the most sense for your business.</p>
<p>Then, when you’re ready, you can use your Amazon product data feed to get new prices up with speed, especially amid moments like Black Friday when you know there are likely a lot of people browsing the marketplace for a deal.</p>
<h3>7. A stronger partnership with Amazon</h3>
<p>Amazon has to manage a slew of seller relationships, and its priority is understandably to ensure its marketplace meets the highest quality standards.</p>
<p>If your listings aren’t properly formatted, for example, or are missing key attributes, it can jeopardize your brand’s future in Amazon’s marketplace.</p>
<p>This is another example of where relying on manual, human effort doesn’t make sense. A product data feed optimized for Amazon reduces the risk of errors. That not only means you’ll avoid being suspended from Amazon’s marketplace program; you could become one of its most trusted eCommerce partners.</p>
<h3>8. Greater capabilities to execute data-driven decision-making</h3>
<p>Amazon wants its sellers to share its customer-obsessed approach to eCommerce. That’s why the company offers analytics tools that let them track their performance. Having the data is only the first step, though.</p>
<p>As you get a better understanding of what’s selling and why, you can begin to make tweaks to your listings that will supercharge your conversion rate. It might be adding more details to a single product listing, offering a promotion based on a possible best-seller or simply ensuring you hold onto the right level of inventory for seasonal products.</p>
<h3>9. An accelerated path to eCommerce expansion</h3>
<p>Creating an Amazon product data feed isn’t an isolated IT project that takes up time and resources. It represents the beginning of a multi-channel sales strategy that can continue to offer dividends.</p>
<p>With your product data optimized, for instance, you can begin to look at other digital channels that are likely to attract your target customers.</p>
<p>This can include<a href="https://highstreet.io/tiktok-product-feeds-for-stronger-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> social media channels like TikTok</a>, for instance, or even one of the growing number of online marketplaces being offered by brands that are already household names, such as<a href="https://highstreet.io/unlock-the-potential-of-macys-marketplace-with-integration-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s</a>.</p>
<h3>10. A customer experience that builds brand loyalty</h3>
<p>Customers who initially discover your brand on Amazon’s marketplace may decide to visit your website to learn more. They might pay greater attention when your products show up on Instagram or Facebook. Some will even opt-in to receive your e-mail newsletter for additional promotions and discounts.</p>
<p>The product data feed you set up on Amazon will let you build a relationship with these customers based on a positive experience, where they find what they want and get it sent their way. When they’re satisfied, it’s not just Amazon that benefits – your brand will too.</p>
<h2>How to create an Amazon product data feed</h2>
<p>Setting up an Amazon product data field involves the following:</p>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Open an Amazon seller central account so you have access to send your product data feed to the marketplace. You’ll need to provide a credit card, tax identification information, and basic business information such as your business name, address, and contact details.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Link your business bank account to your brand’s Amazon seller account.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Choose the local marketplaces Amazon operates that are most relevant to your business in terms of your target customers.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Choose your preferred billing plan – unless you’re selling as an individual this will be a professional plan aimed at corporate entities for a nominal monthly fee.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Complete your tax interview – Amazon needs to verify the professional status of your business.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Enter basic product information – This is where you can clarify whether you’re the manufacturer of the products you’re selling or whether you’re reselling on an OEM’s behalf. You’ll also quantify the volume of products you’ll be selling on Amazon and whether or not you use UPC codes for your products.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Add all the necessary data attributes such as product title, category, SKU, price, images, and URL of each item. Don’t forget critical details such as shipping costs if you’re not using Amazon’s fulfillment service. Be as detailed as possible to provide the best experience for Amazon customers.</li>
<li>Upload your inventory file: Within your Amazon seller account you’ll visit the inventory page and deliver the content in either text or XML format.</li>
</ol>
<p>Be prepared to make changes to this feed as you manage your stock levels, customer demand, and many other factors.</p>
