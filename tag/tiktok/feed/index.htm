										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a consumer “likes” a post you’ve published on social media, it could be an indication they’re interested in the fashion, accessories or other products you’re promoting. A positive comment could suggest affinity with your brand’s style. The ideal response to any social media post, however, is when the consumer clicks on a link or “buy” button that leads to an actual purchase.</p>
<p>As social platforms make it increasingly easier to manage financial transactions directly through their services, retailers are realizing they can use them for far more than marketing activities. In fact, social commerce represents a huge opportunity to convert and grow revenue.</p>
<p>To understand how to sell using social commerce, read on.</p>
<h2>What is Social Shopping or Social Commerce?</h2>
<p>For everyday consumers, social media continues to be a place they come to share photos and videos with their family and friends. While brands initially established their own accounts to advertise products and direct them back to their own eCommerce stores, social commerce means they are now using these platforms to provide a seamless digital shopping experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/07/18/2915426/0/en/The-8-5-Trillion-Global-Market-for-Social-Commerce-2030-Security-Privacy-Concerns-and-Legal-Issues-are-the-Biggest-Challenge-for-Market-Players.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social commerce sales are forecast to reach $8.5 trillion globally by 2030</a>. Clothing is expected to be the fastest-growing category in this space, representing<a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2022/shopping-on-social-media-platforms-expected-to-reach-1-2-trillion-globally-by-2025-new-accenture-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 18% of social commerce sales by 2025</a>. In the U.S. alone,<a href="https://www.abc4.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/728564235/simplicitydx-publishes-2024-state-of-social-commerce-impact-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 77% pursue social shopping at least once per week</a>.</p>
<p>The first step in developing a shoppable storefront on social media is to ensure you can<a href="https://Suvae.org/product-feed-management/social-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> easily connect your product catalog to social platforms</a> where your customers are browsing. Product feed management makes this far easier to accomplish and scalable across multiple social services.</p>
<p>At the same time, you should become familiar with the unique requirements and social shopping opportunities each platform offers.</p>
<h2>Top Social Commerce Platforms</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11566" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-02.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-02.jpg 700w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-02-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Approaching social media as a brand is a lot different than what you might have experienced as a consumer. You’re not just sharing content broadly to the world but taking advantage of channels within each service that can maximize your social commerce sales.</p>
<p>These are some best practices specific to the most popular platforms.</p>
<h3>Mastering Facebook Social Commerce</h3>
<p>The volume of<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/insights/social-commerce-brand-trends-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> consumers shopping on Facebook is expected to reach more than 64.6 million</a> in 2024, making it the largest social commerce platform. To reach that audience:</p>
<h4>Leverage Facebook Shops</h4>
<p>Facebook offers a shoppable storefront where retailers can create collections of their products based on a theme, such as seasonable apparel.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2343035149322466?id=1077620002609475" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Setting up a Facebook Shop</a> allows you to display your brand’s name, logo, ratings and other details in addition to products. It’s also easy for users to discover Facebook Shops through their fields or via a dedicated tab and follow it and make purchases.</p>
<h4>Use Dynamic Ads</h4>
<p>No one has time to make thousands of individual ads to promote every product in their catalog.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/one-sheeters/dynamic-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook’s Dynamic Ads</a> address this by allowing you to promote your entire catalog while also delivering relevant product recommendations to Facebook users based on their interests.</p>
<h4>Engage with Facebook Live</h4>
<p>Retailers have often used the power of a live in-store event to attract shoppers and give them a closeup look at their featured products.<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+live&#038;sca_esv=2a19a3414e05e997&#038;rlz=1C1ONGR_enCA1009CA1009&#038;sxsrf=ADLYWILQUPYLFJsCYdHTWNbSaCLWUA73_A%3A1721660929121&#038;ei=AXaeZtyLB7rgp84PoryNqAw&#038;ved=0ahUKEwickOrg9rqHAxU68MkDHSJeA8UQ4dUDCA8&#038;uact=5&#038;oq=facebook+live&#038;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDWZhY2Vib29rIGxpdmUyChAjGIAEGCcYigUyChAjGIAEGCcYigUyDhAAGIAEGJECGLEDGIoFMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABEjWClDjA1jVBnACeACQAQCYAV-gAYoCqgEBM7gBA8gBAPgBAZgCBKACxgHCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHwgINEAAYgAQYsAMYQxiKBZgDAOIDBRIBMSBAiAYBkAYKkgcBNKAH4BY&#038;sclient=gws-wiz-serp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook Live</a> offers a way to do the exact same thing but on a global scale. Showcase items with live models, answer questions from potential buyers and offer the kind of authentic connection that consumers crave.</p>
<h4>Optimize for Mobile</h4>
<p>It may have started in the days when desktops were still the dominant device for browsing the web, but most consumers are probably scrolling the Facebook app on their smartphone. Make sure you don’t disappoint them by ensuring you’re offering fast page loads and adjusting text and images to display on smaller screens.</p>
<p><b>Feed integration:</b> Facebook Shops and Dynamic Ads need to properly convey every important detail about the items you’re selling. This includes not only names but pricing, images, descriptions, SKUs and availability statuses. Automating Facebook product feed management will render everything consumers need to know in the right format, every time.</p>
<h3>Instagram Social Shopping: Everything You Need to Know</h3>
<p>Whether gazing at photos or watching Reels, Instagram also commands a sizable social shopping audience, with<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/social-media-top-channel-shoppers-worldwide-discover-buy-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 46.8 million expected to make purchases there in 2024</a>. Instagram is also well established as a home for highly engaging fashion and lifestyle content, making it an ideal digital destination for many eCommerce brands. There are plenty of ways to attract customers:</p>
<h4>Utilize Instagram Shopping</h4>
<p>There’s no shorter path to purchase than “see it, buy it,” which is exactly what<a href="https://business.instagram.com/shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Instagram Shopping</a> was designed to offer U.S. retailers. Posts will include one-click access to view collections, detailed product pages or simply buy directly through the app. You’ll need to set up a business profile on Instagram and comply with Instagram’s merchant agreement to get approved. You’ll then be able to tag up to 20 products and shops in a photo feed post, 10 photos and videos in a carousel post.</p>
<h4>Create Shoppable Posts</h4>
<p>Consumers have come to recognize the little shopping bag icon that identifies Shoppable Posts on Instagram, which allow them to streamline the process of ordering a product they want. Bear in mind that they are likely looking at multiple brands on Instagram at any given moment, and Shoppable Posts let them stay in the app even as they make purchases. You can enhance your Shoppable Posts by not only creating enticing images, but adding important context such as sizing, fit or styling.</p>
<h4>Leverage Influencers</h4>
<p>Instagram is a great example of a platform where users are building up audiences that dwarf that of many brands. These creators are also called influencers because consumers pay close attention to products they recommend and endorse. Partnering with influencers can help draw more attention to your Shoppable Posts and other Instagram content to boost your social commerce sales.</p>
<h4>Use Instagram Stories</h4>
<p>Instagram may have originally been focused on photography, but today users can create Stories that blend images, video, text and special effects. Brands can do the same thing, illustrating how their products could be worn or used in a particular context or locale. Instagram Stories are also ideal for conveying the kind of key messages that were once reserved for expensive TV spots, while also offering a fast and easy way to take the next step and buy items.</p>
<p><b>Feed Integration: </b>Developing a shoppable storefront on Instagram requires adding details to its Commerce Manager platform. This includes either connecting your existing catalog or creating a new one. That could be a laborious and error-prone job without a product feed management solution that instantly transmits the right data and accelerates Instagram’s review process.</p>
<h3>Social Shopping on Pinterest: Your Secret Weapon</h3>
<p>Whether you’re decorating your home or creating a board full of outfit ideas, Pinterest is the ultimate way to curate ideas and products that speak to your individual style. No wonder<a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/pinterest-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 85% of Pinterest users have made a purchase based on a pin</a>. Make sure your brand is among those benefiting:</p>
<h4>Optimize Product Pins</h4>
<p><a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en-ca/blog/optimize-your-product-feed-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Every pin you promote as a brand should tell a story</a>. This not only includes visual storytelling with images but metadata such as the keywords you use to describe them. Also make sure to tag across multiple categories where appropriate to maximize discoverability and form product groups with the same care you’d put complementary products on a table in a physical store.</p>
<h4>Use Rich Pins</h4>
<p>Pinterest recognizes that product information should never stay static. That’s why it offers<a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/rich-pins" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Rich Pins</a>, which automatically sync data from your website. This means you can have the latest ingredients in a Recipe Rich Pin, or updated pricing and availability for Product Rich Pins.</p>
<h4>Create Themed Boards</h4>
<p>Pinterest boards don’t have to be random assortments of products. Much like an in-store experience, you’ll provide a better experience for customers by organizing pins based on broader similarities, customer interests and needs. A good example might be a vacation-themed board that includes everything you should buy before setting off on your next getaway.</p>
<h4>Engage with Visual Search</h4>
<p>Shopping inspiration can come from anywhere, but the hard work comes when you need to track down something that appeals to you. Visual search technologies ease that journey by allowing consumers to simply point at an item and look it up online.<a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/article/pinterest-lens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Pinterest Lens</a>, for instance, can drive more consumers to your pins when you have multiple optimized images of your products with accurate data.</p>
<p><b>Feed Integration:</b> Pinterest allows brands to add 50 different data sources, but doing so manually requires many steps, and Pinterest requires data be updated every seven days. This could become a full-time job without an automated feed management solution that can handle this on a scheduled basis.</p>
<h3>TikTok Social Commerce: Go Viral with Your Sales</h3>
<p>Some come for the singing and dancing. Some come for the memes. There are also plenty of people who visit TikTok for both types of content – in addition to hunting for their next luxury item.<a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/tiktok-shop-statistics/#:~:text=More%20than%2055%20million%20TikTok,social%20shoppers%20reaching%2039.5%20million." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> More than 55 million U.S. consumers shopped on TikTok</a> in 2023, either through links in the app or directly on the platform. Now is the time to meet your customers here as well. Here’s how:</p>
<h4>Create Engaging Content</h4>
<p>TikTok first became known for the extreme brevity of its content, as well as a sense of humor that tended to skew towards younger consumers. As the platform grows, its audience will inevitably become more diverse, but the same lighthearted and fun-loving spirit remains. Instead of a hard product pitch, try to develop clips that put what you sell into an unconventional environment, or answer some of the funniest questions you’ve ever been asked by existing customers. If you know some of your loyal customers well, see if they’ll be part of clips that are part of viral trends, such as posts with the #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt hashtag.</p>
<h4>Leverage TikTok Shopping</h4>
<p><a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-tiktok-shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Shop</a> incorporates many of the features of other social shopping platforms, including the ability to be featured on a Shop tab, in-feed and live shopping as well as product showcases. Of course you’ll have to adhere to TikTok’s community guidelines and TikTok Shop policies to set up this kind of shoppable storefront after signing up to its seller program.</p>
<h4>Partner with Creators</h4>
<p>Like Instagram, TikTok is filled with creators who have mastered the art of short-form video. Involve them anywhere from launch campaigns and unboxing opportunities to clips that let them explain to their followers why your products are essential items.</p>
<h4>Use Hashtag Challenges</h4>
<p>TikTok is perhaps the most “gamified” social media platform where<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/branded-hashtag-challenge-harness-the-power-of-participation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> brands can challenge users</a> to compete with one another to create the best content. Examples here could include clips that demonstrate the best use of your products to bring your company’s slogan to life in a new way.</p>
<p><b>Feed Integration:</b> TikTok suggest brands can create new catalogs, upload products from an online file or use a template. There’s actually another, better way: leverage the power of a proven product feed management solution to ensure every attribute is included and leave your</p>
<h2>2024&#8217;s Trends in Social Commerce</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11567 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-03.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-03.jpg 700w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-03-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Social commerce is an ever-moving target. As platforms continue to compete with each other for consumers’ attention, we’ll see them experiment with new technologies and introduce features to drive even more immersive engagement.</p>
<p>Given giants such as Meta not only own Facebook and Instagram but WhatsApp, for instance, expect to see further integration of social commerce within messaging apps that allow consumers to get their contacts’ opinions on their purchases. Evolving mobile device hardware could allow social commerce via augmented and virtual reality. Other areas, such as live shopping, are still nascent and poised for further expansion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There may be a lot of dancing, lip-syncing, and comedic skits when you scroll through your feed, but don’t be fooled: selling on TikTok is serious business, especially when you’re ready to showcase your products to its vast global audience.</p>
<p>In its 2023<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/tiktok-2023-whats-next-trend-report?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> What’s Next Trend Report</a>, TikTok provided its assessment of what keeps consumers coming back to its app for hours on end: the focus on relatable and uplifting has created a community that is ready to take action. Ads<b> with a high entertainment value scored 15% higher for purchase intent.</b></p>
<p>Having a TikTok product feed is just as important as making an ad funny or heartwarming, though. Consumers need to see products with accurate, up-to-date details before they click a “buy” button. When it’s done right, however, selling on <a href="https://Suvae.org/start-selling-on-tik-tok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok could be an important growth driver</a>.</p>
<h2>Benefits of selling on TikTok</h2>
<p>Just consider the results of a survey published in early 2023 that showed<a href="https://getcircuit.com/teams/blog/tiktok-ecommerce-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 83% of consumers believe TikTok will become the home shopping network of our digital age</a>. This has attracted <a href="https://www.theroot.com/rihanna-is-looking-for-the-ultimate-fenty-fan-on-tiktok-1849613824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big brands like Fenty Beauty</a>, which got headlines for running contests and other marketing tactics on TikTok. Another study found <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/tiktok-social-marketing-teens-snap-instagram-piper-sandler/646930/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clothing is a top spending priority for women using TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>Is it worth selling on TikTok? Yes, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s the third-largest social platform, with<a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/charts/global-tiktok-user-stats/#:~:text=TikTok%20will%20have%20834.3%20million,phenomenon%20has%20been%20incredibly%20quick." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> more than 800 million users</a> (and still growing!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Achieving reach within large consumer segments matters, especially when you’re selling luxury products across multiple geographies. Marketing on TikTok should be just as big a priority as being present on other popular channels, such as search engines or display advertising.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though it attracts users of all ages,<a href="https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/tiktok-age-demographics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the largest TikTok segment is between 18-34</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For brands in segments like fashion, this represents one of the most covetable demographics, based on disposable income and typically high levels of shopping and spending activity. It’s an audience where the marketing return on investment (ROI) may be higher.</p>
<ul>
<li>TikTok’s<a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-updates/tiktok/tiktok-discovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> “For You” page</a> is designed to help people discover people brands they don’t know.<br />
Other social platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, organize feeds primarily based on content from someone you’re following. That can make it more difficult to raise brand awareness among new prospects. TikTok’s approach has become so successful it is being replicated on other social platforms, including Twitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>TikTok also provides<b> brands flexibility</b> in terms of creating effective marketing content to reach their business goals, such as driving more revenue, increasing share of wallet among existing customers, and increasing brand affinity. Marketers can create their TikToks using little more than a smartphone, for example, showcasing stylish products in a way that feels native to the platform. Brands can also <b>partner with influencers</b> and creators who already have large followings on TikTok that point them to their TikTok Shop.</p>
<blockquote><p>Get the Details on <a href="https://Suvae.org/start-selling-on-tik-tok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Sell Products on TikTok</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>What Is TikTok Shop?</h2>
<p>Initially available in locations such as Southeast Asia,<a href="https://shop.tiktok.com/business/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> TikTok has continued to roll out TikTok Shop</a>, which allows merchants to display their products to its community, along with directly integrating e-commerce capabilities for shoppers for a smooth purchasing experience.</p>
<p>TikTok Shop also includes tools to manage campaigns, analytics to track marketing performance, and access to collaborate directly with creators.</p>
<p>Selling on TikTok via TikTok Shop isn’t limited to shopping ad campaigns but merchant-led live videos and in-stream videos. For many brands, however, the most natural starting point will be simply setting up a <b>TikTok product feed </b>to ensure their products are being featured where their customers are most likely to be browsing online. Before that, though, it’s important to understand how your ads will show up on the platform.</p>
<h2>TikTok Shopping Ads Formats</h2>
<p>There are also several options for formatting your TikTok ads. You might want to consider trying them all and doubling down on those that prove most successful after running a test for some time.</p>
<p>Live shopping ads, for instance, are probably best suited for a time-sensitive event, such as the launch or availability of a new product. They will be seen in real-time as people are scrolling through TikTok and can be a chance to answer questions and get a work-through of products in detail.</p>
<p>Video shopping ads appear on the “For You” page of the app, which means they might work well as a way to raise brand awareness among consumers who don’t yet know your brand very well. The good thing about these ads is that the videos are shoppable, meaning people can place orders directly if they like what they see.</p>
<p>Catalog listing ads are probably the most familiar format if you’ve run campaigns through channels such as Google. Setting up a TikTok product catalog allows you to curate the items you want to curate and highlight to the app’s discerning audience.</p>
<p>No matter which format you choose, you need to make sure your ads feature the most relevant items from your catalog, which is where a TikTok product feed comes in.</p>
<h2>How To Create A TikTok Product Feed</h2>
<p>Much like other <a href="https://Suvae.org/reach-customers-social-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social commerce platforms</a>, you can begin<a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/create-manage-catalogs?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> setting up a TikTok product feed</a> once you’ve created an account on the TikTok Business Center. This requires time and attention to detail.</p>
<h3>1. Create your TikTok product feed catalog</h3>
<p>With the “Catalog” area of the TikTok Business Center, choose “Add Catalog.” Enter details such as your catalog name and business center account as well as your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Default currency</li>
<li>Targeting location</li>
<li>Industry</li>
</ul>
<p>Select “Create” to finish setting up your catalog.</p>
<h3>2. Choose your product upload option</h3>
<p>From there, you can begin to add items to your TikTok product feed in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>by entering detailed information about each product</li>
<li>by working with a partner that offers a solution to automate your TikTok product feed. In this scenario, we’re walking through all the steps in manually adding products</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve created a catalog, navigate to the area called “Manage” and then “Products.” This will present you with a template to download.</p>
<p>In the same area, select “Add products” and click on “Manually add.” Click “Next” and then begin entering all the required product information. When you’re done, click on “Import.”</p>
<h3>3. Enter product attributes</h3>
<p>TikTok’s Catalog Manager requires<a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/catalog-product-parameters?redirected=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> nine different mandatory fields</a> for every product you sell on its platform. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product images</li>
<li>SKU ID</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Video URLs.</li>
</ul>
<p>To maximize the potential of selling on TikTok, you probably want to consider the 27 optional fields as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Choose a storage format for product attribute data</h3>
<p>Most brands have many different products to include in their feed. Make sure you store them as a CSV, XML, ZIP, or other appropriate format</p>
<h3>5. Establish your feed schedule</h3>
<p>Depending on how often products get updated within your catalog, you may want to schedule feeds on a daily or even hourly basis. Remember that consumers will be expecting all your catalog data to be accurate and error-free. If you’re choosing hourly, you’ll need to indicate the precise time the file updates should begin.</p>
<h3>6. Choose a product update method</h3>
<p>If you’ll be primarily adding or updating details to the items in your TikTok product feed, upload the file you need for each one. If you’re replacing your data feed, you’ll need to upload a new one where the existing one was located. Choose “Import” to complete this process.</p>
<h3>7. Group products into sets</h3>
<p>Find “Product Set” within the “Category area and choose “Create a product set.” From there, you can either manually select one product at a time by clicking on “Manually Select Products” or “Use Filters” to make it easier to create product campaigns. Click “Confirm” when you’re done.</p>
<h3>8. Add new product sources</h3>
<p>Although you need to choose an initial source when you’re first setting up your TikTok product feed, you can introduce others later on. This is done simply by choosing “Add Products” after selecting “Product Sources” in the “Configure” area. Remember that TikTok needs to review all the ads that run on its platform – it suggests only having one data feed per catalog to expedite this process.</p>
<h3>9. Edit and add products</h3>
<p>There is still plenty of opportunity to make changes to your product information after they’ve been added to your catalog. You’ll find the edit button by hovering over the product name, which will allow you to make changes in each field. The product SKU ID has to remain the same, however. If you need to delete a product because it has been discontinued or your brand is no longer carrying it, click a checkmark next to the product and choose “Disable” from a nearby drop-down menu.</p>
<h3>10. Establish TikTok product catalog rules</h3>
<p>Sometimes you’ll want to make minor changes to your product information, and TikTok offers a rules-based mechanism for doing so. Just choose “Product Sources” within your catalog, click on the source name, and select “Add Rules” under the settings tab.</p>
<p>You’ll have several options here. You can opt for “Value Replacement” to swap one value in a product with another, set “Default Value” or even “Mapping” to map a value from your file into a TikTok-supported column. “Regex Replace” is a way of substituting inventory details in your TikTok product feed file with a new value.</p>
<p><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/create-manage-catalogs?redirected=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok’s Business help center offers even more details</a> on every step in this process.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that manually adding products isn’t a one-time exercise. Pricing, for instance, will only be displayed in the currency you chose when your product was created. If you use TikTok to sell into new markets, it will have to be updated. The same goes for changes to product descriptions, SKU IDs, and more.</p>
<h2>Why you should use a product feed management platform for selling on TikTok</h2>
<p>Automating product feed management takes away the hours otherwise spent adding and updating items to your catalog, while also<b> improving the accuracy of all the data</b> your customers will see.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://Suvae.org/product-feed-management/social-ecommerce/">Suvae.org’s Social Commerce service</a>, for example, everything from feed configuration to product data optimization and synchronization is managed for you. Flexible configurations allow you to keep on top of changing channel requirements, and you can connect your analytics platform to track the performance of products you’re selling on TikTok.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adopting a new marketing channel that boosts sales and brand awareness with your target audience isn’t easy. With so many social commerce platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat to choose from, the options are endless.</p>
<p>So why would you start selling on TikTok in addition to the other social channels you’ve integrated with? The simple answer is massive reach and high engagement rates.</p>
<p>Hootsuite reported that as of January 2022, TikTok is the most engaging social media app by far, with an average user session of 10.85 minutes. They have over 1 billion monthly active users worldwide and their ads reach 17.9% of all internet users age 18+.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, advertising on this platform is no longer an experiment for retailers. <strong>TikTok’s annual revenue skyrocketed to 4.6 billion in 2021</strong> and it came in fifth for app lifetime consumer spending worldwide against big players like YouTube.</p>
<p>So, how did TikTok increase its revenue so dramatically in such a short time period? Simply put, revenue from advertisers.</p>
<p>In August of 2021, they partnered with Shopify to launch TikTok Shopping, a feature where users can shop while scrolling through videos or click on a business’s profile and explore products in the Shopping Tab.<br />
Later on, they launched Dynamic Showcase Ads to make it even easier for users to buy and retailers to advertise their products.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Is it worth selling on TikTok?</h2>
<p>The answer is yes. In recent years TikTok has expanded its audience beyond the under-20 crowds. During the COVID pandemic topics like DIY hacks, recipes, travel, health, beauty, and fashion began trending, which attracted a new demographic to the platform. Brands and retailers are now capitalizing on the opportunity to engage with this broader audience by coming up with a separate TikTok marketing strategy focused on the types of videos their audience likes to watch. Not to mention the new social commerce experience that brings in-app shopping and streamlined product discovery to the platform, allowing users to directly shop on TikTok without leaving the app.</p>
<p><b>Some of the major benefits of selling on TikTok include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Drive more brand awareness by developing a new and highly engaged audience</li>
<li>Sell more products by showcasing them in organic posts and ads</li>
<li>Stay relevant with your customers by participating in trends</li>
<li>Create better content that leads to results by tracking your performance</li>

<h2>How do brands go viral on TikTok?</h2>
<p>The options are endless when it comes to developing viral-worthy content but the key is being consistent and creative with your content. Creating a viral video isn’t a perfect science but some of the types of videos that have gone viral fit into these categories.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tutorials</li>
<li>Dance Challenges</li>
<li>Comedic Skits</li>
<li>User-Generated Content</li>
<li>Putting your spin on a trend</li>
</ol>
<p>Ocean Spray is a prime example of a brand gaining recognition through user-generated content on TikTok, without even trying! In 2020 Idaho native, Nathan Apodaca (a laborer at a potato warehouse in Idaho) filmed himself skateboarding while drinking a carton of Cran-Raspberry Ocean Spray. Since then many versions of the video have been posted. Even Ocean Spray’s chief exec Tom Hayes got on his skateboard and recorded a version as part of their content strategy.</p>

<h2>How to sell products on TikTok</h2>
<p>Selling products on TikTok is unique compared to other social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. These platforms have the advantage of a proven track record of driving sales through their platforms.</p>
<p>On the other hand, TikTok is adding more social commerce features and advertising options to compete for marketing dollars.</p>
<h3>Options for selling products on TikTok:</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>TikTok Creator Marketplace</b>: This self-serve portal makes it easy for brands to find a diverse variety of creators that best aligns with their interests.</li>
<li><b>TikTok Creator Marketplace API</b>: This API enables access to our first-party marketplace data for creator marketing experts including Captiv8, Influential, and Whalar to provide brands with white-glove services to help manage the entire end-to-end process of creator marketing on TikTok.</li>
<li><b>Open Application Campaigns</b>: Brands can post campaign briefs to creators across TikTok Creator Marketplace so that they can self-apply and participate.</li>
<li><b>Branded Content Toggle</b>: This tool allows creators to mark videos and disclose commercial content without disrupting their creative flow.</li>
<li><b>Customized Instant Page</b>: Brands can create landing pages that load in seconds – 11x faster than standard mobile pages – to let users dive deeper into a brand’s message by watching videos or swiping through different content similar to promoting your products and brand on other social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. It involves creating content that appeals to your fans.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other options for advertisers to <b>sell products on TikTok</b> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>In-Feed Ads</li>
<li>Brand Takeover Ads</li>
<li>Top View Ads</li>
<li>Branded Hashtag Ads</li>
<li>Branded Effects Ads</li>

<h2>How to engage customers to sell more on TikTok</h2>
<p>Now that you know the options to sell products on TikTok, you need to know how to engage your audience to buy more of your products.</p>
<p>Get familiar with what kind of videos your audience is posting and watching. Fans aren’t interested in a commercial for your product. They’re looking for authenticity, creativity, and a more personal side to your brand.</p>
<p>The platform is extremely interactive so the more you interact with fans by creating or joining challenges or creating inspirational content, the more your target audience will remember what you’re promoting and be motivated to make a purchase.</p>
<h2>About TikTok Dynamic Showcase Ads</h2>
<h3>Reach a Highly Engaged Audience</h3>
<p>In September of 2021, TikTok released <b>Dynamic Showcase Ads (DSAs) to help eCommerce merchants drive awareness</b> of their products and increase purchase intent.<br />
By connecting your product catalog to the platform’s video templates, you can dynamically generate a massive number of personalized product video ads on TikTok.</p>
<p><b>There are two ways to use Dynamic Product Ads on TikTok:</b><br />
<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Prospect to new customers</b><b><br />
</b>TikTok makes personalized recommendations from your product catalog to help drive installs, user acquisition, and sales.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Retarget existing customers/leads</b><b><br />
</b>TikTok will automatically show ads about relevant products to people who have expressed interest in them on your website or app.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Before getting started: Only available for managed accounts based in launched markets can create Dynamic Showcase Ads.</em></p>
<h3>How TikTok Dynamic Showcase Ads work</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a catalog on TikTok Ads Manager.</li>
<li>​Upload products to your catalog.
<ul>
<li><b>Manually Add:</b> Fill out a form for each product.</li>
<li><b>Data Feed Schedule: </b>Automatically import your products from an online file.</li>
<li><b>Upload File:</b> Upload products from a template.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generate videos for the products in your catalog.</li>
<li>​Integrate events between your catalog and measurement partner or TikTok Pixel.</li>
<li>Publish a campaign using the products in your catalog.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to create successful TikTok Dynamic Showcase Ad (DSA) Campaigns</h3>
<p>Just like a plumber needs the right tools, experience, and set up in place to get the best results, the same goes for running Dynamic Showcase Ads on TikTok that convert to sales.</p>
<p>As an eCommerce marketer, the next step of the Ad creation process is where you need to understand what’s involved with <b>uploading your products from a data feed schedule</b>. The more you know about this step the better your ads will perform.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12059" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Create-Successful-TikTok-Dynamic.jpg" alt="Create Successful TikTok Dynamic" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Create-Successful-TikTok-Dynamic.jpg 700w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Create-Successful-TikTok-Dynamic-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><b>Automatically importing your products from an online file</b> involves generating a <b><a href="https://Suvae.org/tiktok-product-feeds-for-stronger-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product feed for TikTok.</a><br />
</b><br />
Creating and managing a product feed that increases product ad conversions demands technical expertise in things like:</p>

<li>Integrating various data sources to create a complete feed</li>
<li>Changing product titles and descriptions from how they’re written in your catalog to fit TikTok’s ad structure</li>
<li>Synchronizing product data changes from your eCommerce catalog to TikTok for up-to-date product prices and other information</li>
</ul>
