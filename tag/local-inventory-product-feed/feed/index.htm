										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the car, on his way home from the office, an executive suddenly remembers his wife asking him to pick up milk. At the doctor’s office, a woman in the waiting room reads a recipe in a magazine and gets inspired. Just as his after-work basketball game wraps up, a young man realizes he has little left in the cupboard.</p>
<p>Although some grocery shopping begins with planning at home, many consumers decide to make a trip to their local store in the moment, while on the move. <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/3246303?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local search ads</a>, much like local inventory ads (LIAs), are increasingly the way they decide where they’ll go to buy their favorite foods.</p>
<h2>What are Local Search Ads?</h2>
<p>When consumers search for a term like “grocery store,” there are any number of brands that might show up in results based on the search engine optimization (SEO) quality of their content. In this case, however, consumers want the most relevant suggestions, which means identifying grocery stores nearby. This is where local search ads can help.</p>
<p>Using location extensions within Google Merchant Center (GMC), for example, local search ads ensure that Google will run the ads above more general search results and even provide directions to minimize the time spent traveling to get to a grocery store.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Local Search Ads</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-15588 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Benefits-of-local-search-ads.jpg" alt="Benefits of local search ads" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Benefits-of-local-search-ads.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Benefits-of-local-search-ads-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Consumers are becoming more thoughtful than ever before in where they grocery shop. This is in part due to rising food costs, but also because they know they can quickly compare multiple brands at once with a quick search on their smartphones. As a result, <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/8-trends-grocery-industry-2023/639547/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greater competition has been a rising trend across the grocery sector</a>.</p>
<p>Local search ads on Google Maps can make sense as a response to this trend because they focus on the convenience of shopping for groceries at the nearest possible store.</p>
<p>Other benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>A more effective use of your digital advertising budget:</b> While other marketing tactics could nurture customers over time, local searches are often tied to more immediate purchase intent. This can mean a greater return on investment (ROI) for pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns.</li>
<li><b></b><b>More data for analysis and insights</b>: Tracking the path to purchase from local searches to in-store visits can help you see opportunities to optimize your website and other aspects of the digital experience you’re delivering to potential customers.</li>
<li><b></b><b>Details that drive decisions:</b> Consumers don’t just need to know which stores operate in their neighborhood. They also want to ensure they don’t show up when a store has closed, or whether it offers more than one way to get the items they want. Local search ads on Google Maps provide plenty of room to include particulars such as store hours and whether they offer delivery or in-store pickup.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Google Local Search Ads vs. Local Inventory Ads</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-15597 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oil-newyork2-phone-2.jpg" alt="Google Local Search Ads vs. Local inventory Ads" width="750" height="854" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oil-newyork2-phone-2.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oil-newyork2-phone-2-480x547.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grocery stores aren’t limited to local advertising campaigns based on search ads alone.<a href="https://Suvae.org/local-inventory-ads-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Successful brands also take advantage of local inventory ads (LIAs)</a>, which provide even more granular specifics about a brand’s products to help customers shop.</p>
<p>Instead of a generic search for “grocery stores,” for example, consumers might be shopping with a special ingredient in mind. A Google LIA could highlight that ingredient – whether it’s a kind of bread, a sauce, or a cut of meat – to confirm it’s in stock at a nearby location.</p>
<p>This goes a step further than Google business ads that are based on a grocery store’s <a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Profile</a> (formerly Google My Business). Instead of simply verifying a business is operating and listing its store locations, a Google LIA lets you feature products that are part of an overall Google Shopping campaign by linking the Business Profile with GMC and Google Ads.</p>
<p>A Google LIA also requires having accurate, up-to-date data on your product availability, which is supported by a product feed management solution. This is why<a href="https://Suvae.org/customer-success-stories/carrefour-brings-greater-accuracy-to-local-inventory-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> leading grocery brands like Carrefour have worked with Suvae.org</a> to help manage their LIAs.</p>
<h2>Best practices for running local campaigns as part of a successful marketing strategy</h2>
<p>A Google Local Inventory Ads can work hand-in-hand with Google Local Search Ads to provide the kind of immediate, comprehensive information consumers want and expect. Make sure you consider the following as you begin exploring further:</p>
<h3>How will seasonality influence customer needs?</h3>
<p>Grocery stores know it’s time to showcase turkeys in their stores as holidays like Christmas get closer, or to vegetable skewers when barbecue season arrives. Consumers may be increasing local searches amid these seasonal periods as their schedules get busier, so use the right ad tools to reach them.</p>
<h3>What will drive long-term customer loyalty?</h3>
<p>Customers will be grateful to find a local grocery store when they’re in a pinch, but they may go out of their way to return if they can get a good deal. Think about how you could use local search advertising to boost the effectiveness of discounts and other promotions.</p>
<h3>Where will the customer journey take people?</h3>
<p>Consumers may prefer to not only search online but buy that way too. Enabling e-commerce options provides greater flexibility and can be highlighted as part of local advertising campaigns. Don’t stop there, though: think through whether customers will shop locally because they want a shorter distance for shipping, or whether you should offer in-store or curbside pickup. If they come in-store, strive to offer personalized campaigns that can build a unique and emotional connection with your brand.</p>
<h2>Take the next step with local advertising campaigns</h2>
<p>If you haven’t already, set up your Google Business Profile so that it can be easily connected with GMC and you can begin leveraging location extensions in search ads.</p>
<p>Much like the products you’re advertising, meanwhile, your business is likely in a state of constant change. You can avoid the risk of outdated or incomplete details in your profile by connecting with a partner like Suvae.org which specializes in<a href="https://Suvae.org/business-listing-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> business listing management</a>. This includes curating, optimizing, and distributing all the data necessary to rise in search rankings and gain more search traffic.</p>
<p>When it comes time to pair local search ads with a Google LIA, work with a partner like Suvae.org to allow inventory data to be updated easily and consistently, while also taking away the manual effort that can otherwise put a strain on your resources.</p>
<p>Grocery stores are the ultimate example of the kind of local business consumers depend upon. Make their lives easier and <a href="https://Suvae.org/contact-us/">grow your business by connecting with Suvae.org </a>to make the most of search advertising.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ask your customers how often they enjoy waiting in line at a physical store and the most likely answer is ”Never.” The same is probably true if you ask them what it feels like to be put on hold when they call in to ask basic questions, such as whether the product they’re looking for is in stock or not.</p>
<p>Worst of all is when they place an online order and find themselves clicking the “order status” button on their digital receipt over and over again, wondering if shipping delays are getting between them and what they bought.</p>
<p>As more people turn to online channels as a key part of their shopping experience, product availability, and proximity are becoming what defines success in almost every kind of business.<br />
This is why understanding the difference between local text ads and Google LIA — and how to use them — is an essential part of your e-commerce strategy.</p>
<h2>Why Thinking Global But Acting Local Is More Important Than Ever</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10955" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Harness-the-Power-01.jpg" alt="How To Harness the Power Of Local Text Ads And Local Inventory Ads In The Emerging ‘Neighborhood Economy’" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>As eMarketer recently reported,<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/3-new-things-retail-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> e-commerce sales are expected to continue double-digit growth</a> in the U.S. alone to almost 18 percent in 2021 and will make up an estimated 20 percent of all retail sales by 2024.</p>
<p>The explosion of online shopping makes it easier to overlook an even more important retail transformation. While the Internet provides global reach for even the smallest businesses, customer behavior is creating what we might call a “neighborhood economy,” where the ability to meet customers where they are is the ultimate competitive differentiator.</p>
<p>As proof, consider that <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-to-win-local-search/416837/%23close" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local search has become the second most important channel</a> after organic search, according to a recent article in the <i>Search Engine Journal</i>.</p>
<p>This makes intuitive sense: Customers may start their research by looking broadly on Google for the products that interest them, but their buying decision will largely be driven by the convenience and speed of the retailer they choose.</p>
<h2>How Local Text Ads Work</h2>
<p>This is where local text ads in Google Ads campaigns provide a way to help streamline the experience for potential customers. By using location-targeted campaigns whose ad groups are used to configure local keywords and local ads, local text ads answer an urgent question:</p>
<p><strong><i>“Where are [luxury designer jackets] near me?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Local text ads can drive conversions with only a headline, a display URL, and a brief description.<br />
Even within those creative constraints, it’s possible to convey a unique selling proposition in a way that immediately builds credibility.<br />
Think of someone who’s looking for ethically produced cashmere sweaters. When they search on Google, they might see an ad like the fictitious one below before they even scroll down to see the organic results:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Cashmere wool sweaters with sustainability in mind</strong><br />

<h2>Google LIA at a glance</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10957" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Harness-the-Power-02.jpg" alt="How To Harness the Power Of Local Text Ads And Local Inventory Ads In The Emerging ‘Neighborhood Economy’" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>As an extension of Google Ads campaigns, Local Inventory Ads are based on Google Merchant Center, and a linked Google My Business account.</p>
<p>Here are a few other important details that differentiate Google LIA from local text ads:</p>
<ul>
<li>While local text ads can be used to promote cars, travel services, and almost anything else that Google Ads supports, local inventory focuses on selected categories. These include apparel, accessories, and many other retail products.</li>
<li>Google LIAs are also managed by Google, which assigns areas and location keywords using data from a linked Google My Business account.</li>
<li>Consumers might land on local inventory ads when they enter a search on Google like, “designer handbags near me,” or “buy pencil skirts in [city or town].”</li>
<li>Beyond text, Google LIAs allow retailers to feature images of their product as well as the price or other details such as measurements.</li>
</ul>
<p>When consumers click through, local inventory ads also act as digital storefronts by answering all the other frequently asked questions (FAQs) that run through customers’ minds. The ad will tell them exactly how far away a store location is, for instance, hours of operation, and more details about the product.</p>
<h2>Why a Local-First Approach to the Customer Journey Matters</h2>
<p>Customers may continue to randomly visit stores to see if a product is available, but increased concerns around safety protocols and simply the time they potentially waste mean they’re increasingly likely to begin their search online.</p>
<p>Based on what they learn from local text ads or local inventory ads, consumers can arm themselves with information to take the next step in their journey.</p>
<p>For some, this might include making an in-person visit, but not necessarily in the store environment. They might order online for curbside delivery instead.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10961" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Harness-the-Power-03.jpg" alt="How To Harness the Power Of Local Text Ads And Local Inventory Ads In The Emerging ‘Neighborhood Economy’" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>Local text and local inventory ads aren’t just great marketing tools. They are also ways to ensure customers don’t get frustrated or disappointed in their search and provide just enough details to offer value and guide customers to the right purchases.<br />
This helps businesses create the same kind of trusted relationships that people have always had with their favorite neighborhood shops.</p>
<p>Product feed management technology offers an ability to enhance the use of Google LIAs by optimizing the journey between marketing, sales, and beyond. <a href="https://Suvae.org/product-feed-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Explore what the future of your e-commerce experience could look like</a>, and feel free to contact us to learn more.</p>

<h3><strong>1.</strong> <strong> Use the Pick-up Today&#8221;</strong> <strong>option </strong></h3>
<p>Promote items in stock at your local store with the &#8220;Pick-up Today&#8221; option. Use the following attribute values in your local products inventory feed:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>availability: “in stock” ○ pickup_method: “buy”</li>
<li>pickup_sla: “same day” or “next day”</li>
<li>Add the attribute “pickup_price” in your local inventory feed to specify your distinct pickup prices. If your pickup price is the same as your national price, use the price attribute in the Local Products feed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10006 size-large" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-pick-up-today-2-1024x546.jpg" alt="lia-pick-up-today" width="1024" height="546" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-pick-up-today-2-980x523.jpg 980w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-pick-up-today-2-480x256.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>2. Use the Pick-up Later&#8221; option</strong></h3>
<p>For out-of-stock items or if you don’t know the exact in-store inventory at a local store, use the &#8220;<strong>Pickup later&#8221;</strong> option. You can ship them to the local store for a shopper to pick up.<br />Use the following attribute values in your local product inventory feed:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>
<p class="p1">availability: “out of stock”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1">pickup_method: “ship to store”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1">pickup_sla: choose one of the following values 1-day, 2-day, 3-day, 4-day, 5-day, 6-day, 7-day, multi-week</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>3. Bid higher for shoppers closer to your store</strong></h3>
<p>Use the location extension bid modifiers to increase bids for shoppers close to your stores.</p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-10010 size-full aligncenter" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-bidding-1.jpg" alt="lia-bidding" width="750" height="400" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-bidding-1.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-bidding-1-480x256.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>4. Increase bids when stores are open</strong></h3>
<p>Ensure all hours are in blue. Avoid turning off ads outside store hours so shoppers can always find your products.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-10011 size-full aligncenter" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-campaigns.jpg" alt="lia-campaigns" width="750" height="400" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-campaigns.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-campaigns-480x256.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>5. Regularly update sale items</strong> i<strong>n your Local Product Feed</strong></h3>
<p>Your in-store sales may be different than your eCommerce sales: Remember to update your local inventory product feed with current sales.  And, when the sale is over, don&#8217;t forget to remove the sale price from your feed!</p>

<p>Another way you can differentiate your Local Inventory Campaigns is by creating landing pages for each product available in-store.<br />Most merchants will either use Google&#8217;s LIA landing page or the existing product page on their website that has an in-store buying option. But, these two types of pages don&#8217;t provide the user with a rich experience that meets all of their needs.</p>
<p>As a third alternative, you can provide a richer online user experience that is directly relevant to both the products and the location of the shopper. How?<br /><a href="https://Suvae.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suvae.org</a> has designed and implemented <strong>dynamically generated landing pages</strong> that are directly relevant to both the products and the location of the physical selling points.</p>

<p>This <strong>enhanced product page</strong> displays side-by-side a product data sheet (one or more products, with a detailed view for a title, a picture, the price, product variants, related products, sale price, and the availability of the product in the displayed store).</p>
<p>Included in this page template, you&#8217;ll get a <strong>customizable widget</strong> with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of the store</li>
<li>Main address and contact information such as phone, website, opening hours, etc.</li>
<li>Google map of where the product is available in-store</li>
</ul>
