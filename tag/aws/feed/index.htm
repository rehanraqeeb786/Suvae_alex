										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tools you use to manage your eCommerce business are as valuable as the keys to a flagship store. Those systems contain priceless information about your inventory, your orders, and your </span><a href="https://Suvae.org/how-data-feed-management-enhances-your-digital-marketing-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">product feed that connect to online marketplaces and essential digital channels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>That’s why they need to be protected with the kind of security that AWS Cognito MFA (multi-factor authentication) can provide.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like showing an employee identification card when you show up in an office, authentication technologies are a way to confirm that only authorized people are logging into your backend infrastructure.<br />
For years, authentication was often limited to the use of passwords, even though they were often forgotten by employees and easy to guess by cybercriminals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides additional layers of protection to digital platforms</strong> by requiring additional credentials. These could include something you know, such as a PIN, sending a text to your smartphone, or even scanning biometric data like your fingerprint or your face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Suvae.org, we’re reducing the burden on brands to<strong> focus on security and offer peace of mind by standardizing our user authentication</strong> based on AWS Cognito MFA.</span></p>
<p>This post offers some more detail on our approach, and why it will let you spend more time on the products you’re selling and the customers you’re serving.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platform Authentication – A Technical Choice Using AWS</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve standardized on AWS Cognito MFA because it was purposely designed to help organizations authenticate and manage users whether they’re looking into a web portal or a mobile app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Suvae.org’s case, the main component for authentication is based on a directory of people who will need to access the platform, which is called a user pool.</span></p>
<p>This provides a seamless way to manage each user’s profile while also checking for suspicious activity such as an attempt by a hacker to take over someone’s account or to verify a credential like an e-mail address.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We like Cognito MFA because it’s scalable as more users get added, and it also allows customization at the user interface (UI) level, which means we can provide a front end that’s familiar and easy to use.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Components of the Infrastructure Authentication</span></h2>
<p>When you put a key in a lock, you don’t usually get to see the gears and other components that turn and allow you to open a door. The diagram below provides an insider view of what happens when your users are logging into Suvae.org.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14191" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HS-authentication.drawio.jpg" alt="HS authentication drawio" width="750" height="360" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HS-authentication.drawio.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HS-authentication.drawio-480x230.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system makes use of Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), which are environments where application programming interfaces (APIs) can be created and run in isolation from the underlying hardware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re trying to authenticate who you are, the user pool grants tokens that authorize requests that get made to the containerized HTTP API.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve been authenticated, you can dive into Suvae.org and begin </span><a href="https://Suvae.org/new-omnichannel-shopping-experience-retailers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">configuring your product feeds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more accurate ads, marketplace listings, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infrastructure as Code</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping this kind of backend infrastructure with the needs of a business would have traditionally required a lot of time and effort, but Suvae.org’s use of infrastructure has changed all that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is infrastructure as code? Think of it as a way of using coding to automate complex processes rather than relying on manual (and often error-prone work).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More specifically, we learn about Terraform’s infrastructure as code software to create, change and improve our user authentication.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Suvae.org stands: What you get as a Customer</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining infrastructure as code with AWS Cognito MFA, we’re able to provide a<strong> cost-effective, high-speed, consistent, and secure user authentication experience</strong> that benefits all our customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having complete control and visibility over who’s logging on at all times also means Suvae.org can continuously improve our approach to AWS Cognito multi-factor authentication.<br />
Terraform helps us keep track of versioning so that changes to the underlying infrastructure can happen incrementally, as new eCommerce needs emerge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might not think about how users are logging into Suvae.org on a day-to-day basis, or whether your organization is at any risk of an IT security incident. That’s a good sign we’re doing our jobs right – and another great reason to count on us as a <strong>trusted feed management partner.</strong></span></p>
