										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a consumer “likes” a post you’ve published on social media, it could be an indication they’re interested in the fashion, accessories or other products you’re promoting. A positive comment could suggest affinity with your brand’s style. The ideal response to any social media post, however, is when the consumer clicks on a link or “buy” button that leads to an actual purchase.</p>
<p>As social platforms make it increasingly easier to manage financial transactions directly through their services, retailers are realizing they can use them for far more than marketing activities. In fact, social commerce represents a huge opportunity to convert and grow revenue.</p>
<p>To understand how to sell using social commerce, read on.</p>
<h2>What is Social Shopping or Social Commerce?</h2>
<p>For everyday consumers, social media continues to be a place they come to share photos and videos with their family and friends. While brands initially established their own accounts to advertise products and direct them back to their own eCommerce stores, social commerce means they are now using these platforms to provide a seamless digital shopping experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/07/18/2915426/0/en/The-8-5-Trillion-Global-Market-for-Social-Commerce-2030-Security-Privacy-Concerns-and-Legal-Issues-are-the-Biggest-Challenge-for-Market-Players.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social commerce sales are forecast to reach $8.5 trillion globally by 2030</a>. Clothing is expected to be the fastest-growing category in this space, representing<a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2022/shopping-on-social-media-platforms-expected-to-reach-1-2-trillion-globally-by-2025-new-accenture-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 18% of social commerce sales by 2025</a>. In the U.S. alone,<a href="https://www.abc4.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/728564235/simplicitydx-publishes-2024-state-of-social-commerce-impact-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 77% pursue social shopping at least once per week</a>.</p>
<p>The first step in developing a shoppable storefront on social media is to ensure you can<a href="https://Suvae.org/product-feed-management/social-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> easily connect your product catalog to social platforms</a> where your customers are browsing. Product feed management makes this far easier to accomplish and scalable across multiple social services.</p>
<p>At the same time, you should become familiar with the unique requirements and social shopping opportunities each platform offers.</p>
<h2>Top Social Commerce Platforms</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11566" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-02.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-02.jpg 700w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-02-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Approaching social media as a brand is a lot different than what you might have experienced as a consumer. You’re not just sharing content broadly to the world but taking advantage of channels within each service that can maximize your social commerce sales.</p>
<p>These are some best practices specific to the most popular platforms.</p>
<h3>Mastering Facebook Social Commerce</h3>
<p>The volume of<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/insights/social-commerce-brand-trends-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> consumers shopping on Facebook is expected to reach more than 64.6 million</a> in 2024, making it the largest social commerce platform. To reach that audience:</p>
<h4>Leverage Facebook Shops</h4>
<p>Facebook offers a shoppable storefront where retailers can create collections of their products based on a theme, such as seasonable apparel.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2343035149322466?id=1077620002609475" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Setting up a Facebook Shop</a> allows you to display your brand’s name, logo, ratings and other details in addition to products. It’s also easy for users to discover Facebook Shops through their fields or via a dedicated tab and follow it and make purchases.</p>
<h4>Use Dynamic Ads</h4>
<p>No one has time to make thousands of individual ads to promote every product in their catalog.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/one-sheeters/dynamic-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook’s Dynamic Ads</a> address this by allowing you to promote your entire catalog while also delivering relevant product recommendations to Facebook users based on their interests.</p>
<h4>Engage with Facebook Live</h4>
<p>Retailers have often used the power of a live in-store event to attract shoppers and give them a closeup look at their featured products.<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+live&#038;sca_esv=2a19a3414e05e997&#038;rlz=1C1ONGR_enCA1009CA1009&#038;sxsrf=ADLYWILQUPYLFJsCYdHTWNbSaCLWUA73_A%3A1721660929121&#038;ei=AXaeZtyLB7rgp84PoryNqAw&#038;ved=0ahUKEwickOrg9rqHAxU68MkDHSJeA8UQ4dUDCA8&#038;uact=5&#038;oq=facebook+live&#038;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDWZhY2Vib29rIGxpdmUyChAjGIAEGCcYigUyChAjGIAEGCcYigUyDhAAGIAEGJECGLEDGIoFMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABEjWClDjA1jVBnACeACQAQCYAV-gAYoCqgEBM7gBA8gBAPgBAZgCBKACxgHCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHwgINEAAYgAQYsAMYQxiKBZgDAOIDBRIBMSBAiAYBkAYKkgcBNKAH4BY&#038;sclient=gws-wiz-serp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook Live</a> offers a way to do the exact same thing but on a global scale. Showcase items with live models, answer questions from potential buyers and offer the kind of authentic connection that consumers crave.</p>
<h4>Optimize for Mobile</h4>
<p>It may have started in the days when desktops were still the dominant device for browsing the web, but most consumers are probably scrolling the Facebook app on their smartphone. Make sure you don’t disappoint them by ensuring you’re offering fast page loads and adjusting text and images to display on smaller screens.</p>
<p><b>Feed integration:</b> Facebook Shops and Dynamic Ads need to properly convey every important detail about the items you’re selling. This includes not only names but pricing, images, descriptions, SKUs and availability statuses. Automating Facebook product feed management will render everything consumers need to know in the right format, every time.</p>
<h3>Instagram Social Shopping: Everything You Need to Know</h3>
<p>Whether gazing at photos or watching Reels, Instagram also commands a sizable social shopping audience, with<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/social-media-top-channel-shoppers-worldwide-discover-buy-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 46.8 million expected to make purchases there in 2024</a>. Instagram is also well established as a home for highly engaging fashion and lifestyle content, making it an ideal digital destination for many eCommerce brands. There are plenty of ways to attract customers:</p>
<h4>Utilize Instagram Shopping</h4>
<p>There’s no shorter path to purchase than “see it, buy it,” which is exactly what<a href="https://business.instagram.com/shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Instagram Shopping</a> was designed to offer U.S. retailers. Posts will include one-click access to view collections, detailed product pages or simply buy directly through the app. You’ll need to set up a business profile on Instagram and comply with Instagram’s merchant agreement to get approved. You’ll then be able to tag up to 20 products and shops in a photo feed post, 10 photos and videos in a carousel post.</p>
<h4>Create Shoppable Posts</h4>
<p>Consumers have come to recognize the little shopping bag icon that identifies Shoppable Posts on Instagram, which allow them to streamline the process of ordering a product they want. Bear in mind that they are likely looking at multiple brands on Instagram at any given moment, and Shoppable Posts let them stay in the app even as they make purchases. You can enhance your Shoppable Posts by not only creating enticing images, but adding important context such as sizing, fit or styling.</p>
<h4>Leverage Influencers</h4>
<p>Instagram is a great example of a platform where users are building up audiences that dwarf that of many brands. These creators are also called influencers because consumers pay close attention to products they recommend and endorse. Partnering with influencers can help draw more attention to your Shoppable Posts and other Instagram content to boost your social commerce sales.</p>
<h4>Use Instagram Stories</h4>
<p>Instagram may have originally been focused on photography, but today users can create Stories that blend images, video, text and special effects. Brands can do the same thing, illustrating how their products could be worn or used in a particular context or locale. Instagram Stories are also ideal for conveying the kind of key messages that were once reserved for expensive TV spots, while also offering a fast and easy way to take the next step and buy items.</p>
<p><b>Feed Integration: </b>Developing a shoppable storefront on Instagram requires adding details to its Commerce Manager platform. This includes either connecting your existing catalog or creating a new one. That could be a laborious and error-prone job without a product feed management solution that instantly transmits the right data and accelerates Instagram’s review process.</p>
<h3>Social Shopping on Pinterest: Your Secret Weapon</h3>
<p>Whether you’re decorating your home or creating a board full of outfit ideas, Pinterest is the ultimate way to curate ideas and products that speak to your individual style. No wonder<a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/pinterest-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 85% of Pinterest users have made a purchase based on a pin</a>. Make sure your brand is among those benefiting:</p>
<h4>Optimize Product Pins</h4>
<p><a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en-ca/blog/optimize-your-product-feed-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Every pin you promote as a brand should tell a story</a>. This not only includes visual storytelling with images but metadata such as the keywords you use to describe them. Also make sure to tag across multiple categories where appropriate to maximize discoverability and form product groups with the same care you’d put complementary products on a table in a physical store.</p>
<h4>Use Rich Pins</h4>
<p>Pinterest recognizes that product information should never stay static. That’s why it offers<a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/rich-pins" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Rich Pins</a>, which automatically sync data from your website. This means you can have the latest ingredients in a Recipe Rich Pin, or updated pricing and availability for Product Rich Pins.</p>
<h4>Create Themed Boards</h4>
<p>Pinterest boards don’t have to be random assortments of products. Much like an in-store experience, you’ll provide a better experience for customers by organizing pins based on broader similarities, customer interests and needs. A good example might be a vacation-themed board that includes everything you should buy before setting off on your next getaway.</p>
<h4>Engage with Visual Search</h4>
<p>Shopping inspiration can come from anywhere, but the hard work comes when you need to track down something that appeals to you. Visual search technologies ease that journey by allowing consumers to simply point at an item and look it up online.<a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/article/pinterest-lens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Pinterest Lens</a>, for instance, can drive more consumers to your pins when you have multiple optimized images of your products with accurate data.</p>
<p><b>Feed Integration:</b> Pinterest allows brands to add 50 different data sources, but doing so manually requires many steps, and Pinterest requires data be updated every seven days. This could become a full-time job without an automated feed management solution that can handle this on a scheduled basis.</p>
<h3>TikTok Social Commerce: Go Viral with Your Sales</h3>
<p>Some come for the singing and dancing. Some come for the memes. There are also plenty of people who visit TikTok for both types of content – in addition to hunting for their next luxury item.<a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/tiktok-shop-statistics/#:~:text=More%20than%2055%20million%20TikTok,social%20shoppers%20reaching%2039.5%20million." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> More than 55 million U.S. consumers shopped on TikTok</a> in 2023, either through links in the app or directly on the platform. Now is the time to meet your customers here as well. Here’s how:</p>
<h4>Create Engaging Content</h4>
<p>TikTok first became known for the extreme brevity of its content, as well as a sense of humor that tended to skew towards younger consumers. As the platform grows, its audience will inevitably become more diverse, but the same lighthearted and fun-loving spirit remains. Instead of a hard product pitch, try to develop clips that put what you sell into an unconventional environment, or answer some of the funniest questions you’ve ever been asked by existing customers. If you know some of your loyal customers well, see if they’ll be part of clips that are part of viral trends, such as posts with the #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt hashtag.</p>
<h4>Leverage TikTok Shopping</h4>
<p><a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-tiktok-shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Shop</a> incorporates many of the features of other social shopping platforms, including the ability to be featured on a Shop tab, in-feed and live shopping as well as product showcases. Of course you’ll have to adhere to TikTok’s community guidelines and TikTok Shop policies to set up this kind of shoppable storefront after signing up to its seller program.</p>
<h4>Partner with Creators</h4>
<p>Like Instagram, TikTok is filled with creators who have mastered the art of short-form video. Involve them anywhere from launch campaigns and unboxing opportunities to clips that let them explain to their followers why your products are essential items.</p>
<h4>Use Hashtag Challenges</h4>
<p>TikTok is perhaps the most “gamified” social media platform where<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/branded-hashtag-challenge-harness-the-power-of-participation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> brands can challenge users</a> to compete with one another to create the best content. Examples here could include clips that demonstrate the best use of your products to bring your company’s slogan to life in a new way.</p>
<p><b>Feed Integration:</b> TikTok suggest brands can create new catalogs, upload products from an online file or use a template. There’s actually another, better way: leverage the power of a proven product feed management solution to ensure every attribute is included and leave your</p>
<h2>2024&#8217;s Trends in Social Commerce</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11567 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-03.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-03.jpg 700w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-03-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Social commerce is an ever-moving target. As platforms continue to compete with each other for consumers’ attention, we’ll see them experiment with new technologies and introduce features to drive even more immersive engagement.</p>
<p>Given giants such as Meta not only own Facebook and Instagram but WhatsApp, for instance, expect to see further integration of social commerce within messaging apps that allow consumers to get their contacts’ opinions on their purchases. Evolving mobile device hardware could allow social commerce via augmented and virtual reality. Other areas, such as live shopping, are still nascent and poised for further expansion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know what to do when we see the long, thin box on the front of Google’s home page: enter a brand name or a product category to help its search engine take us on the next step of a shopping journey.</p>
<p>As omnichannel marketing and selling become more sophisticated, however, many of us will soon be keeping our eyes open for brands that offer another option: visual search.</p>
<h2>What is Visual Search?</h2>
<p>Rather than typing in text to a search engine or using a voice assistant to make a query, visual search involves uploading or somehow adding an image to browse for answers online.</p>
<p>The formats for visual searches could include a photo that shoppers have taken while browsing the aisles or racks of a physical store or a screenshot they’ve taken from a website, among others. Once they’ve done so, the experience is much like that of a traditional Google search, where they see similar items to whatever appears in the image and links back to the source of the content.</p>
<h2>Launching a visual search eCommerce strategy</h2>
<p>Though your use of visual search will depend in part on the products you’re selling and the needs of your customer base, the following steps are a great way to get started:</p>
<h3>1. Identify visual search examples that align with your brand</h3>
<p>Though it may be less familiar than other forms of browsing the Web, several visual search tools are already widely available to consumers.<a href="https://lens.google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google Lens</a>, for instance, uses artificial intelligence such as machine learning to identify objects, translate text, and look for information by pointing your smartphone camera at an object like a dress or piece of furniture.</p>
<p>Depending on the image it’s scanning, Google Lens can take shoppers directly to a brand’s eCommerce website or a third-party online marketplace that contains inventory matching what’s being shown.</p>
<p>Microsoft has also moved into the visual search arena by<a href="https://searchengineland.com/visual-search-now-live-in-bing-chat-429527" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> adding features to Bing Chat</a>. This means that when customers land on a site that uses it, a Bing visual search feature will allow people to upload images as part of the “dialogue” they have with the chatbot to streamline the process of getting the response they want.</p>
<p>There is a Pinterest visual search option as well.<a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/article/pinterest-lens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Pinterest Lens</a> works by simply tapping the camera icon on its app, pinching or zooming in to an object, pressing a button, and then exploring anything similar that’s been published on other boards.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-16318 size-full" title="Pinterest visual search" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pinterest2.jpg" alt="Pinterest visual search" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pinterest2.jpg 1200w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pinterest2-980x653.jpg 980w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pinterest2-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1200px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Even Apple has made sure to incorporate visual search tools into its<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/21/vision-pro-visual-search-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Vision Pro headset</a>, which complements similar capabilities on the iPhone and iPad.</p>
<h3>2. Make a business case for visual search tools based on human behavior</h3>
<p>The connection between online search and visual data is nothing new. Consider the fact that since launching more than 20 years ago, Google Images now accounts for 10% of the company’s daily search traffic.</p>
<p>Research has found that<a href="https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/bid/350326/studies-confirm-the-power-of-visuals-in-elearning" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> visual information makes up 90% of what’s transmitted in the brain</a>, perhaps because 40% of nerve fibers are linked to our eyes’ retinas. That could explain why we can get a sense of what’s going on in an image in less than 1/10 of a second.</p>
<p>You only have to scroll through TikTok or Instagram to see how emphasizing visuals has transformed social media, which are among the top channels for trying to reach younger demographics. No wonder eMarketer published data in 2022 showing<a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/younger-shoppers-trying-visual-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> that 30% of U.S. adults aged 34 and younger have used visual search for shopping</a>, and 12% were already using it regularly.</p>
<h3>3. Study the brands that are already using visual search</h3>
<p>If you’re still not sure that providing customers with visual search tools is a priority, just look at some of the leading brands that have already moved forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/16/grokstyles-visual-search-tech-makes-it-into-ikeas-place-ar-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA</a>, for instance, has integrated visual search into its app, enhancing the augmented reality experience that allows consumers to create interior designs from wherever they are. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kaleighmoore/2019/09/04/why-more-retail-brands-are-launching-visual-search-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glasses USA</a> has done something similar with a tool called “Pic and Pair” to help consumers find the best designer frames for their faces.</p>
<p><a href="https://press.nordstrom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/12-things-you-didnt-know-about-nordstrom-and-nordstrom-rack-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nordstrom</a>, meanwhile, has been offering visual search eCommerce for several years, and<a href="https://www.aboutwayfair.com/tech-innovation/object-detection-and-visual-search-improvements" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> W</a>ayfair makes it easy to use images as part of its search experience as well.</p>
<h3>4. Check which online marketplaces are offering visual search eCommerce</h3>
<p>Shoppers are not only depending on using images when they land on a brand’s eCommerce site but when they’re looking to<a href="https://Suvae.org/top-online-marketplaces-for-fashion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> promote products on third-party online marketplaces</a> as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.asos.com/us/customer-care/product-stock/how-does-your-style-match-feature-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asos</a>, for instance, has made it easy for online shoppers to upload an image of a piece of clothing they like to its marketplace app and serve up recommended items directly from its product catalog. Amazon is also at the forefront with its<a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/resource-center/amazon-influencers-introducing-stylesnap" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Shop The Look</a> software to shop for clothes and accessories.</p>
<h3>5. Craft compelling images to make the most of visual search tools</h3>
<p>Once you’ve understood the technology and recognized where your products can be found using visual search, you’ll need to ensure you have the right content to make the most of it. The art of developing product visuals that will work well with emerging search technologies isn’t rocket science. It follows many of the same best practices that brands may already have adopted when they learned about<a href="https://Suvae.org/facebook-and-google-ads-image-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> image optimization</a> as part of creating Google Shopping Ads.</p>
<p>To drive more conversions, for example, you’ll want to stick with clutter-free images in common formats like JPEG or TIFF. You should also pay attention to the structure of URLs, and sizing and ensure you’re showing products in use.</p>
<h2>Building an effective and successfull Social Commerce Strategy</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There may be a lot of dancing, lip-syncing, and comedic skits when you scroll through your feed, but don’t be fooled: selling on TikTok is serious business, especially when you’re ready to showcase your products to its vast global audience.</p>
<p>In its 2023<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/tiktok-2023-whats-next-trend-report?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> What’s Next Trend Report</a>, TikTok provided its assessment of what keeps consumers coming back to its app for hours on end: the focus on relatable and uplifting has created a community that is ready to take action. Ads<b> with a high entertainment value scored 15% higher for purchase intent.</b></p>
<p>Having a TikTok product feed is just as important as making an ad funny or heartwarming, though. Consumers need to see products with accurate, up-to-date details before they click a “buy” button. When it’s done right, however, selling on <a href="https://Suvae.org/start-selling-on-tik-tok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok could be an important growth driver</a>.</p>
<h2>Benefits of selling on TikTok</h2>
<p>Just consider the results of a survey published in early 2023 that showed<a href="https://getcircuit.com/teams/blog/tiktok-ecommerce-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 83% of consumers believe TikTok will become the home shopping network of our digital age</a>. This has attracted <a href="https://www.theroot.com/rihanna-is-looking-for-the-ultimate-fenty-fan-on-tiktok-1849613824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big brands like Fenty Beauty</a>, which got headlines for running contests and other marketing tactics on TikTok. Another study found <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/tiktok-social-marketing-teens-snap-instagram-piper-sandler/646930/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clothing is a top spending priority for women using TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>Is it worth selling on TikTok? Yes, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s the third-largest social platform, with<a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/charts/global-tiktok-user-stats/#:~:text=TikTok%20will%20have%20834.3%20million,phenomenon%20has%20been%20incredibly%20quick." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> more than 800 million users</a> (and still growing!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Achieving reach within large consumer segments matters, especially when you’re selling luxury products across multiple geographies. Marketing on TikTok should be just as big a priority as being present on other popular channels, such as search engines or display advertising.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though it attracts users of all ages,<a href="https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/tiktok-age-demographics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the largest TikTok segment is between 18-34</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For brands in segments like fashion, this represents one of the most covetable demographics, based on disposable income and typically high levels of shopping and spending activity. It’s an audience where the marketing return on investment (ROI) may be higher.</p>
<ul>
<li>TikTok’s<a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-updates/tiktok/tiktok-discovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> “For You” page</a> is designed to help people discover people brands they don’t know.<br />
Other social platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, organize feeds primarily based on content from someone you’re following. That can make it more difficult to raise brand awareness among new prospects. TikTok’s approach has become so successful it is being replicated on other social platforms, including Twitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>TikTok also provides<b> brands flexibility</b> in terms of creating effective marketing content to reach their business goals, such as driving more revenue, increasing share of wallet among existing customers, and increasing brand affinity. Marketers can create their TikToks using little more than a smartphone, for example, showcasing stylish products in a way that feels native to the platform. Brands can also <b>partner with influencers</b> and creators who already have large followings on TikTok that point them to their TikTok Shop.</p>
<blockquote><p>Get the Details on <a href="https://Suvae.org/start-selling-on-tik-tok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Sell Products on TikTok</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>What Is TikTok Shop?</h2>
<p>Initially available in locations such as Southeast Asia,<a href="https://shop.tiktok.com/business/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> TikTok has continued to roll out TikTok Shop</a>, which allows merchants to display their products to its community, along with directly integrating e-commerce capabilities for shoppers for a smooth purchasing experience.</p>
<p>TikTok Shop also includes tools to manage campaigns, analytics to track marketing performance, and access to collaborate directly with creators.</p>
<p>Selling on TikTok via TikTok Shop isn’t limited to shopping ad campaigns but merchant-led live videos and in-stream videos. For many brands, however, the most natural starting point will be simply setting up a <b>TikTok product feed </b>to ensure their products are being featured where their customers are most likely to be browsing online. Before that, though, it’s important to understand how your ads will show up on the platform.</p>
<h2>TikTok Shopping Ads Formats</h2>
<p>There are also several options for formatting your TikTok ads. You might want to consider trying them all and doubling down on those that prove most successful after running a test for some time.</p>
<p>Live shopping ads, for instance, are probably best suited for a time-sensitive event, such as the launch or availability of a new product. They will be seen in real-time as people are scrolling through TikTok and can be a chance to answer questions and get a work-through of products in detail.</p>
<p>Video shopping ads appear on the “For You” page of the app, which means they might work well as a way to raise brand awareness among consumers who don’t yet know your brand very well. The good thing about these ads is that the videos are shoppable, meaning people can place orders directly if they like what they see.</p>
<p>Catalog listing ads are probably the most familiar format if you’ve run campaigns through channels such as Google. Setting up a TikTok product catalog allows you to curate the items you want to curate and highlight to the app’s discerning audience.</p>
<p>No matter which format you choose, you need to make sure your ads feature the most relevant items from your catalog, which is where a TikTok product feed comes in.</p>
<h2>How To Create A TikTok Product Feed</h2>
<p>Much like other <a href="https://Suvae.org/reach-customers-social-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social commerce platforms</a>, you can begin<a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/create-manage-catalogs?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> setting up a TikTok product feed</a> once you’ve created an account on the TikTok Business Center. This requires time and attention to detail.</p>
<h3>1. Create your TikTok product feed catalog</h3>
<p>With the “Catalog” area of the TikTok Business Center, choose “Add Catalog.” Enter details such as your catalog name and business center account as well as your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Default currency</li>
<li>Targeting location</li>
<li>Industry</li>
</ul>
<p>Select “Create” to finish setting up your catalog.</p>
<h3>2. Choose your product upload option</h3>
<p>From there, you can begin to add items to your TikTok product feed in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>by entering detailed information about each product</li>
<li>by working with a partner that offers a solution to automate your TikTok product feed. In this scenario, we’re walking through all the steps in manually adding products</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve created a catalog, navigate to the area called “Manage” and then “Products.” This will present you with a template to download.</p>
<p>In the same area, select “Add products” and click on “Manually add.” Click “Next” and then begin entering all the required product information. When you’re done, click on “Import.”</p>
<h3>3. Enter product attributes</h3>
<p>TikTok’s Catalog Manager requires<a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/catalog-product-parameters?redirected=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> nine different mandatory fields</a> for every product you sell on its platform. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product images</li>
<li>SKU ID</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Video URLs.</li>
</ul>
<p>To maximize the potential of selling on TikTok, you probably want to consider the 27 optional fields as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tiktok-Feed-Structure.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16173 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tiktok-Feed-Structure-mni3.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="819" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Choose a storage format for product attribute data</h3>
<p>Most brands have many different products to include in their feed. Make sure you store them as a CSV, XML, ZIP, or other appropriate format</p>
<h3>5. Establish your feed schedule</h3>
<p>Depending on how often products get updated within your catalog, you may want to schedule feeds on a daily or even hourly basis. Remember that consumers will be expecting all your catalog data to be accurate and error-free. If you’re choosing hourly, you’ll need to indicate the precise time the file updates should begin.</p>
<h3>6. Choose a product update method</h3>
<p>If you’ll be primarily adding or updating details to the items in your TikTok product feed, upload the file you need for each one. If you’re replacing your data feed, you’ll need to upload a new one where the existing one was located. Choose “Import” to complete this process.</p>
<h3>7. Group products into sets</h3>
<p>Find “Product Set” within the “Category area and choose “Create a product set.” From there, you can either manually select one product at a time by clicking on “Manually Select Products” or “Use Filters” to make it easier to create product campaigns. Click “Confirm” when you’re done.</p>
<h3>8. Add new product sources</h3>
<p>Although you need to choose an initial source when you’re first setting up your TikTok product feed, you can introduce others later on. This is done simply by choosing “Add Products” after selecting “Product Sources” in the “Configure” area. Remember that TikTok needs to review all the ads that run on its platform – it suggests only having one data feed per catalog to expedite this process.</p>
<h3>9. Edit and add products</h3>
<p>There is still plenty of opportunity to make changes to your product information after they’ve been added to your catalog. You’ll find the edit button by hovering over the product name, which will allow you to make changes in each field. The product SKU ID has to remain the same, however. If you need to delete a product because it has been discontinued or your brand is no longer carrying it, click a checkmark next to the product and choose “Disable” from a nearby drop-down menu.</p>
<h3>10. Establish TikTok product catalog rules</h3>
<p>Sometimes you’ll want to make minor changes to your product information, and TikTok offers a rules-based mechanism for doing so. Just choose “Product Sources” within your catalog, click on the source name, and select “Add Rules” under the settings tab.</p>
<p>You’ll have several options here. You can opt for “Value Replacement” to swap one value in a product with another, set “Default Value” or even “Mapping” to map a value from your file into a TikTok-supported column. “Regex Replace” is a way of substituting inventory details in your TikTok product feed file with a new value.</p>
<p><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/create-manage-catalogs?redirected=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok’s Business help center offers even more details</a> on every step in this process.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that manually adding products isn’t a one-time exercise. Pricing, for instance, will only be displayed in the currency you chose when your product was created. If you use TikTok to sell into new markets, it will have to be updated. The same goes for changes to product descriptions, SKU IDs, and more.</p>
<h2>Why you should use a product feed management platform for selling on TikTok</h2>
<p>Automating product feed management takes away the hours otherwise spent adding and updating items to your catalog, while also<b> improving the accuracy of all the data</b> your customers will see.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://Suvae.org/product-feed-management/social-ecommerce/">Suvae.org’s Social Commerce service</a>, for example, everything from feed configuration to product data optimization and synchronization is managed for you. Flexible configurations allow you to keep on top of changing channel requirements, and you can connect your analytics platform to track the performance of products you’re selling on TikTok.</p>
<p>Though it’s just one of many possible channels you can turn into a shoppable storefront, TikTok’s popularity is impossible to ignore.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember how that eye-catching Facebook ad grabbed your attention? The timing was perfect, the product was exactly what you were looking for, and the price was right. You clicked on the ad, thinking you would buy it immediately, but the checkout process took longer than expected, and you didn’t have time to finish. Later that day you went back to proceed with the purchase, but your item was gone, and of course, you couldn’t find the product page. Your FOMO (fear of missing out) was real. If only you could see that same ad again to take you back.</p>
<p>This type of buyer journey happens more often than you think. To prevent your business from missing out on the sales from these customers, include Facebook Retargeting Ads as a part of your Advantage+ catalog campaigns (formerly Dynamic Product Ads).</p>
<p><strong>Retargeting reduces cart abandonment by 6.5%. (MotoCMS)</strong></p>
<p>Retargeting ads work by reminding customers about products they&#8217;ve previously visited or bought on your website, mobile app, Marketplace, or Facebook/Instagram Shop. This popular marketing tactic helps retailers <strong>increase the performance of shopping campaigns on Facebook</strong>.<br />
Find out more about the benefits of Facebook retargeting ads and how to get more engagement from personalized and up-to-date product catalog campaigns.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Running Facebook Retargeting Ads</h2>
<p>Just like getting a regular oil change for your car to get the best performance, running Facebook retargeting ads is an essential part of getting the most ROI from your Facebook Catalog Ads (Advantage+) media spend.</p>
<p><b>Benefits include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Pushing abandoned cart users to buy</li>
<li>Re-engaging previous customers</li>
<li>Converting customers with high intent</li>
<li>Increasing brand awareness</li>
<li>Acquiring new customers</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Retarget on Facebook with Catalog Ads</h2>
<p>A Facebook Retargeting Campaign can only be done if you’ve already run previous campaigns. With a Facebook pixel on your website or App you can build a retargeting audience to use for future ads.<br />
The following steps from the Facebook website will help you create a retargeting campaign from start to finish.</p>

<h2>Retargeting Platforms and Tools for Running Facebook Retargeting Ads</h2>
<p>If you’re an eCommerce retailer looking to scale your retargeting campaigns, there are a variety of platforms that can help you streamline your advertising.<br />
Here are some popular ones that larger retailers use to run their campaigns.<b></b></p>
<ul>

<li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>
</ul>
<h2>Improve your Facebook Retargeting Ads and Ad Performance Over Time</h2>
<p>The devil is in the details when it comes to increasing the performance of your Facebook Retargeting ads. If your previous campaign fell short of your marketing goals, get to the root of the problem to improve your ROI for next time.</p>
<p><b>To help you gain a better understanding of how to interpret your results, ask yourself these three questions</b></p>
<ol>
<li>How did this campaign compare to previous campaigns?
<ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Were there different products?</li>
<li>Was the time of year the same?</li>
<li>Were there similar promotions?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did the ads have all of the correct product information displayed in an enticing format to encourage a purchase?</li>
<li>Did you have enough personalized audience data to retarget in a way that would achieve your goal, like converting users who abandoned their cart?</li>
</ol>
<p><b>A lesser-known but extremely important question involves the quality and structure of the product data that impact the effectiveness of your ads.</b></p>
<p>When it comes to advertising your catalog in different countries with <a href="https://Suvae.org/set-up-multiple-facebook-product-catalogs-with-product-feeds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple catalogs</a>, product information like price, sale price, currency, and language may be different in each country. Take these factors into consideration to develop a <a href="https://Suvae.org/create-a-multi-country-product-feed-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-country and multi-currency feed</a> strategy based on the campaign’s target country.</p>
<p>Other factors that affect ad performance are the keywords and placement of product differentiators in areas like your product title and description. Optimizing these parts of your product feed allows you to position your products in the best possible way to your audience.</p>
<p>This is where Suvae.org’s technology can help. The platform optimizes the product data used in your Facebook catalog ads. Having better-optimized product data leads to better results from your retargeting ads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Successful brands are constantly trying to find the best way to build trust and credibility with their target customers. While there are many channels and formats that can work, YouTube ads are proof that – from an eCommerce perspective &#8212; seeing is believing.</p>
<p>As Google’s research has shown, for example,<a href="https://blog.google/products/ads/new-ways-to-drive-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 70% of viewers say they have bought a product after viewing YouTube ads</a> about it.</p>
<p>Part of this success can be attributed to the reach and immersive nature of the platform. Just over<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/611707/online-video-time-spent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 27% of consumers admit they watch more than 10 hours</a> of YouTube video content each week. The rise of smartphones and tablets, meanwhile, means retailers investing in YouTube ads can reach their audience from any location. This could be why research has shown<a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/youtube-mobile-advertising-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> that paid YouTube advertising is 84% more likely to capture viewers’ attention than TV</a>.</p>
<p>This means brands have an opportunity to treat online video as more than an extension of their sales and marketing strategy. Instead, they can begin selling on YouTube by managing it as a virtual storefront in its own right.</p>
<h2>Secrets of Selling on YouTube</h2>
<p>Creating YouTube video ads doesn’t necessarily depend on hiring an agency or aiming for the kind of production values we associate with movies and TV shows. A simple clip created on a smartphone can work, provided it tells a compelling story about your audience and how your product aligns with their wants and needs.</p>
<p>Once you’ve developed video content you’re ready to market via YouTube, make sure you’ve addressed the areas below:</p>
<h3>1. Apply SEO Best Practices To Boost Organic Visibility</h3>
<p>When people type queries into Google today, a YouTube clip is as likely to pop up in the results as a link to a page of text. Make sure you haven’t overlooked any opportunities to be on the first page of <a href="https://Suvae.org/search-engine-product-listing-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search results</a> by optimizing your content accordingly.</p>
<p>People aren’t just watching content on YouTube, for example. They’re also often reading the description below the video for more context and to find out more about who created it. This is where you can embed popular keyword phrases and links back to your site and even direct them to specific product pages or e-commerce URLs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12562 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bestperfume_chanel-1.jpg" alt="youtube ads" width="700" height="392" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bestperfume_chanel-1.jpg 700w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bestperfume_chanel-1-480x269.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Remember to focus on the common aspirations or problems your target customers face as you write these titles and descriptions. “Best,” “ultimate” or “top” may reflect the kind of goods luxury shoppers are seeing. “Why,” “How” and “Where” might address difficulties they’re having finding a specific kind of product.</p>
<h3>2. Leverage In-Feed Video Ads To Drive Discovery</h3>
<p>You might be trying to drive awareness of your brand and its products. Maybe you’re trying to boost consideration of your products over the competition or have specific revenue targets to meet. Regardless of your eCommerce marketing objective, in-feed ads offer a highly effective means of achieving it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12568" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/youtube-ads-browser.jpg" alt="youtube shopping ads" width="700" height="518" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Formerly known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmapXl9K-ro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video discovery ads</a>, in-feed ads on YouTube maximize your exposure to potential customers in places they’re most likely to notice your brand. This not only includes the YouTube home feed but in search results when people are browsing for specific video content. In-feed ads can also make your video the “Watch Next” clip YouTube recommends, allowing viewers to continue an experience they’re already begun by exploring your brand and its products.</p>
<p>Rather than content that is simply a hard sell, make sure videos served through in-feed ads provide high value to YouTube’s audience. This could include a tutorial about how to address a common problem, answers to frequently asked questions, or review-style walkthroughs that showcase the details about a product.</p>
<h3>3. Save Viewers Time and Drive Interactive Engagement with Shoppable Ads</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12567" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/skip-ads2.jpg" alt="shoppable ads" width="500" height="1010" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/skip-ads2.jpg 500w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/skip-ads2-480x970.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Brands understandably want to drive people directly to their site as often as possible, but that’s not where most people want to spend the majority of their time. A better customer journey would be to let them stay on YouTube – or social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest – and make purchases directly. In this sense, social media platforms are also channels for <a href="https://Suvae.org/reach-customers-social-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social commerce</a>. This is the core value shoppable ads offer eCommerce merchants.</p>
<p>Though they vary depending on where they’re featured, shoppable ads on YouTube (also known as Video Action Campaigns) streamline the process of viewers taking the next step after a clip has sparked their intention to buy. By bringing <a href="https://Suvae.org/product-feed-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product feed management</a> into YouTube ads, for instance, prospects can instantly view your inventory and click to purchase without leaving YouTube.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12548" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Video-Action-Campaigns.jpg" alt="Video Action Campaigns" width="700" height="421" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Video-Action-Campaigns.jpg 700w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Video-Action-Campaigns-480x289.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TrueView for Shopping is similar in that it allows retailers to directly <a href="https://Suvae.org/google-merchant-center-feed-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect a Google Merchant Center (GMC) account to their product feed</a>, developing a more sophisticated call to action (CTA) for selling on YouTube, where the content can expand into a series of links to your inventory.</p>
<h2>Getting Started With YouTube Video Ads</h2>
<p>Treating YouTube as a virtual storefront offers plenty of room for creativity and a variety of approaches in marketing your products to a highly engaged audience. That makes it easier to experiment and measure the results of selling on YouTube and to continuously optimize your approach.</p>
<p>Suvae.org has already helped our clients realize the potential of YouTube for brands in fashion, consumer electronics, and many other categories.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adopting a new marketing channel that boosts sales and brand awareness with your target audience isn’t easy. With so many social commerce platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat to choose from, the options are endless.</p>
<p>So why would you start selling on TikTok in addition to the other social channels you’ve integrated with? The simple answer is massive reach and high engagement rates.</p>
<p>Hootsuite reported that as of January 2022, TikTok is the most engaging social media app by far, with an average user session of 10.85 minutes. They have over 1 billion monthly active users worldwide and their ads reach 17.9% of all internet users age 18+.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, advertising on this platform is no longer an experiment for retailers. <strong>TikTok’s annual revenue skyrocketed to 4.6 billion in 2021</strong> and it came in fifth for app lifetime consumer spending worldwide against big players like YouTube.</p>
<p>So, how did TikTok increase its revenue so dramatically in such a short time period? Simply put, revenue from advertisers.</p>
<p>In August of 2021, they partnered with Shopify to launch TikTok Shopping, a feature where users can shop while scrolling through videos or click on a business’s profile and explore products in the Shopping Tab.<br />
Later on, they launched Dynamic Showcase Ads to make it even easier for users to buy and retailers to advertise their products.</p>

<li>Why using an optimized TikTok data feed helps you increase product visibility &amp; better campaign performance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is it worth selling on TikTok?</h2>
<p>The answer is yes. In recent years TikTok has expanded its audience beyond the under-20 crowds. During the COVID pandemic topics like DIY hacks, recipes, travel, health, beauty, and fashion began trending, which attracted a new demographic to the platform. Brands and retailers are now capitalizing on the opportunity to engage with this broader audience by coming up with a separate TikTok marketing strategy focused on the types of videos their audience likes to watch. Not to mention the new social commerce experience that brings in-app shopping and streamlined product discovery to the platform, allowing users to directly shop on TikTok without leaving the app.</p>
<p><b>Some of the major benefits of selling on TikTok include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Drive more brand awareness by developing a new and highly engaged audience</li>
<li>Sell more products by showcasing them in organic posts and ads</li>
<li>Stay relevant with your customers by participating in trends</li>
<li>Create better content that leads to results by tracking your performance</li>

<h2>How do brands go viral on TikTok?</h2>
<p>The options are endless when it comes to developing viral-worthy content but the key is being consistent and creative with your content. Creating a viral video isn’t a perfect science but some of the types of videos that have gone viral fit into these categories.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tutorials</li>
<li>Dance Challenges</li>
<li>Comedic Skits</li>
<li>User-Generated Content</li>
<li>Putting your spin on a trend</li>
</ol>
<p>Ocean Spray is a prime example of a brand gaining recognition through user-generated content on TikTok, without even trying! In 2020 Idaho native, Nathan Apodaca (a laborer at a potato warehouse in Idaho) filmed himself skateboarding while drinking a carton of Cran-Raspberry Ocean Spray. Since then many versions of the video have been posted. Even Ocean Spray’s chief exec Tom Hayes got on his skateboard and recorded a version as part of their content strategy.</p>

<h2>How to sell products on TikTok</h2>
<p>Selling products on TikTok is unique compared to other social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. These platforms have the advantage of a proven track record of driving sales through their platforms.</p>
<p>On the other hand, TikTok is adding more social commerce features and advertising options to compete for marketing dollars.</p>
<h3>Options for selling products on TikTok:</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>TikTok Creator Marketplace</b>: This self-serve portal makes it easy for brands to find a diverse variety of creators that best aligns with their interests.</li>
<li><b>TikTok Creator Marketplace API</b>: This API enables access to our first-party marketplace data for creator marketing experts including Captiv8, Influential, and Whalar to provide brands with white-glove services to help manage the entire end-to-end process of creator marketing on TikTok.</li>
<li><b>Open Application Campaigns</b>: Brands can post campaign briefs to creators across TikTok Creator Marketplace so that they can self-apply and participate.</li>
<li><b>Branded Content Toggle</b>: This tool allows creators to mark videos and disclose commercial content without disrupting their creative flow.</li>
<li><b>Customized Instant Page</b>: Brands can create landing pages that load in seconds – 11x faster than standard mobile pages – to let users dive deeper into a brand’s message by watching videos or swiping through different content similar to promoting your products and brand on other social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. It involves creating content that appeals to your fans.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other options for advertisers to <b>sell products on TikTok</b> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>In-Feed Ads</li>
<li>Brand Takeover Ads</li>
<li>Top View Ads</li>
<li>Branded Hashtag Ads</li>
<li>Branded Effects Ads</li>
<li>Dynamic Showcase Ads</li>
</ul>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12056" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-do-you-Sell-on-TikTok.jpg" alt="How do you Sell on TikTok" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-do-you-Sell-on-TikTok.jpg 700w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-do-you-Sell-on-TikTok-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<h2>How to engage customers to sell more on TikTok</h2>
<p>Now that you know the options to sell products on TikTok, you need to know how to engage your audience to buy more of your products.</p>
<p>Get familiar with what kind of videos your audience is posting and watching. Fans aren’t interested in a commercial for your product. They’re looking for authenticity, creativity, and a more personal side to your brand.</p>
<p>The platform is extremely interactive so the more you interact with fans by creating or joining challenges or creating inspirational content, the more your target audience will remember what you’re promoting and be motivated to make a purchase.</p>
<h2>About TikTok Dynamic Showcase Ads</h2>
<h3>Reach a Highly Engaged Audience</h3>
<p>In September of 2021, TikTok released <b>Dynamic Showcase Ads (DSAs) to help eCommerce merchants drive awareness</b> of their products and increase purchase intent.<br />
By connecting your product catalog to the platform’s video templates, you can dynamically generate a massive number of personalized product video ads on TikTok.</p>
<p><b>There are two ways to use Dynamic Product Ads on TikTok:</b><br />
<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Prospect to new customers</b><b><br />
</b>TikTok makes personalized recommendations from your product catalog to help drive installs, user acquisition, and sales.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Retarget existing customers/leads</b><b><br />
</b>TikTok will automatically show ads about relevant products to people who have expressed interest in them on your website or app.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Before getting started: Only available for managed accounts based in launched markets can create Dynamic Showcase Ads.</em></p>
<h3>How TikTok Dynamic Showcase Ads work</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a catalog on TikTok Ads Manager.</li>
<li>​Upload products to your catalog.
<ul>
<li><b>Manually Add:</b> Fill out a form for each product.</li>
<li><b>Data Feed Schedule: </b>Automatically import your products from an online file.</li>
<li><b>Upload File:</b> Upload products from a template.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generate videos for the products in your catalog.</li>
<li>​Integrate events between your catalog and measurement partner or TikTok Pixel.</li>
<li>Publish a campaign using the products in your catalog.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10001003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get In-depth information on each of these steps</a></em></p>
<h3>How to create successful TikTok Dynamic Showcase Ad (DSA) Campaigns</h3>
<p>Just like a plumber needs the right tools, experience, and set up in place to get the best results, the same goes for running Dynamic Showcase Ads on TikTok that convert to sales.</p>
<p>As an eCommerce marketer, the next step of the Ad creation process is where you need to understand what’s involved with <b>uploading your products from a data feed schedule</b>. The more you know about this step the better your ads will perform.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12059" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Create-Successful-TikTok-Dynamic.jpg" alt="Create Successful TikTok Dynamic" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Create-Successful-TikTok-Dynamic.jpg 700w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Create-Successful-TikTok-Dynamic-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><b>Automatically importing your products from an online file</b> involves generating a <b><a href="https://Suvae.org/tiktok-product-feeds-for-stronger-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product feed for TikTok.</a><br />
</b><br />
Creating and managing a product feed that increases product ad conversions demands technical expertise in things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrating various data sources to create a complete feed</li>
<li>Changing product titles and descriptions from how they’re written in your catalog to fit TikTok’s ad structure</li>
<li>Synchronizing product data changes from your eCommerce catalog to TikTok for up-to-date product prices and other information</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enhance your TikTok Ads with a Product Feed Management Partner</h2>
<p>If you do not have the right technical expertise and in-house resources to create and manage high-quality feeds, relying on a product feed management partner might be the best approach.<br />
Suvae.org platform can help you:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billions of people use social networking sites like Facebook and Instagram to connect with friends &amp; family,<br />
According to Business of Apps, <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram has grown from 1 billion users in 2018 to 1.41 in 2021</a> and <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook has grown from 2.23 billion to 2.9 billion users</a> in the same period.<br />
But for a global fashion brand, does it make sense to integrate your store directly with these platforms? The answer is an absolute yes.</p>
<p>The rise of digital marketplaces, social media shopping, and eCommerce continues to drive increased demand for popular brands to make their products available through social media marketplaces.<br />
This exact reason led Facebook to create a Facebook Shop for eCommerce businesses looking to create online storefronts through Facebook and Instagram. With mobile eCommerce expected to reach a $3.56 trillion value in 2021, it’s clear why this is the focus today. Facebook Shop is free to use, allowing companies to add their products to the most popular social networks available.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive into the benefits of a Facebook Shop for your international brand,  how a Facebook Shop differs from an Instagram Shop, and examples of both in practice.</p>
<h2>Facebook Shop Benefits: The 6 Cs</h2>
<h2><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10927" style="color: #666666; font-size: 14px;" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/head-Benefits-of-Facebook2.jpg" alt="The Benefits of Facebook Shops For Global Brands &amp; Retailers" width="700" height="467" /></h2>
<p>Launching your storefront with Shops is one of the best steps you can take to boost your chance of success. Why? The platform offers several features that brands and retailers will be interested in.</p>
<h3>1. Complete Customization</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10929" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facebook-Shops-Customization.jpg" alt="The Benefits of Facebook Shops For Global Brands &amp; Retailers" width="700" height="292" /></p>
<p>You have <strong>complete control over what your storefront will look like online</strong>. Tweak the colors, graphics, typefaces, buttons, and general layout to match how you want your brand image to look.<br />
Best of all, even marketers with little design or technical experience can take advantage of the platform’s easy-to-use tools. You even get a mobile preview on the side for instant feedback.</p>
<h3>2. Collections</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10930" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Facebook-Shops-Collection.jpg" alt="The Benefits of Facebook Shops For Global Brands &amp; Retailers" width="700" height="233" /></p>
<p><strong>Easily manage what products you want to show</strong> off the most. No matter how many different items you need to juggle, keep them organized through Collections, a feature for effectively cataloging your products.</p>
<p>Just head to the Shops customization page, go to “layout,” and click “add collection” to get started. Collections work best when you have a lineup of related products released together, such as a summer collection or a “back to school” sale.<br />
Collections themselves just look pretty and can catch the eyes of passing visitors with their beautiful imagery and design.</p>
<h3>3. Convenient Communication</h3>
<div style="padding-left: 22px;">
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10936" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/head-Benefits-of-Facebook4.png" alt="" width="300" height="394" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/head-Benefits-of-Facebook4.png 389w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/head-Benefits-of-Facebook4-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Facebook Shop is connected to major social networks, with <strong>access to communication tools like WhatsApp and Messenger for direct responses to customer questions and comments.</strong><br />
This real-time nature of your conversations will boost customer retention, and enhance your ability to provide personalized experiences.</p>
</div>
<h3>4. Custom Audiences</h3>
<div style="padding-left: 22px;">
<p>Just like any online storefront, advertising and how you reach the right shoppers to <strong>maximize engagement</strong> are extremely important. In a nutshell, everyone who’s ever viewed or bought products from you or otherwise showed some sort of interest gets grouped into your own Custom Audience.</p>
<p>You have a chance to re-target these people for advertising with an option to filter based on certain demographic traits like location, age, and gender.</p>
</div>
<h3>5. Compatibility with eCommerce Tools</h3>
<div style="padding-left: 22px;">
<p>To help you navigate the lucrative but also complicated world of online commerce, several third-party market integration tools are available to businesses today. Facebook is working with <strong>multiple partners to integrate your products with Facebook Shop</strong>, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://Suvae.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Suvae.org</strong></a></li>
<li>WooCommerce</li>
<li>Shopify</li>
<li>Channel Advisor</li>
<li>Feedonomics</li>
<li>And various others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Marketing and selling products on Facebook Shop is all about using the right tools and taking advantage of the <strong>massive audience</strong> you have with Facebook and Instagram.</p>
</div>
<h3>6. Collecting Insights and Analytics</h3>
<div style="padding-left: 22px;">
<p>Detailed analytics are extremely valuable to eCommerce companies, as they provide <strong>actionable insights into your sales and products</strong>. Facebook and Instagram have a built-in Insights feature within the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/713927982072352?id=1077620002609475&amp;ref=fb4b_shops_products" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commerce Manager</a>. From there, you can find data regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visitor traffic, both how much and where they are coming from</li>
<li>Demographic of your target market</li>
<li>Tagged content</li>
<li>Catalog insights</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also view <strong>statistics based on your needs,</strong> according to a date range, or by the site (either only Facebook or only Instagram).</p>
</div>
<h2>Facebook Shop vs Marketplace</h2>
<p>Facebook Shop and Facebook Marketplace are indeed distinct features provided by Facebook, and they serve different purposes with their unique functionalities.<br />
Here&#8217;s a brief comparison:</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Shop:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Facebook Shop is a feature designed for businesses and brands to set up an online storefront on their Facebook Page or Instagram profile. It allows businesses to showcase their products and services in a more organized and branded way.</li>
<li><strong>E-commerce:</strong> It enables businesses to list products, provide product details, and pricing, and link directly to their website for purchasing.</li>
<li><strong>Customization:</strong> You can customize the look and feel of your shop to align with your brand&#8217;s identity.</li>
<li><strong>Payments:</strong> Customers can make purchases through integrated payment systems, and you can manage orders within Facebook.</li>
<li><strong>Business Insights:</strong> Provides access to business insights and analytics to help track the performance of your shop.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Facebook Marketplace:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Facebook Marketplace is designed for individuals to buy and sell products locally within their community. It&#8217;s a platform for users to list items for sale or browse items for purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Local Transactions:</strong> It focuses on local transactions, and you can filter listings based on location and category.</li>
<li><strong>User-to-User Sales:</strong> Typically used for peer-to-peer sales, such as selling used items, furniture, electronics, and more.</li>
<li><strong>No E-commerce Integration:</strong> Unlike Facebook Shop, Marketplace doesn&#8217;t provide a platform for businesses to create a branded storefront or integrate e-commerce functionalities.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> Buyers and sellers can communicate through Facebook Messenger to arrange transactions and meetings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Facebook Shop is more suitable for businesses and brands looking to establish an online store presence, while Facebook Marketplace is oriented toward local, person-to-person transactions. The choice between the two depends on your goals and whether you are an individual looking to buy or sell used items locally or a business looking to showcase and sell products to a broader online audience.</p>
<h2>Facebook Shop vs Instagram Shop</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 22px;">
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10932" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/head-Benefits-of-Facebook3.jpg" alt=" Facebook Shops Benefits vs. Instagram Shops Benefits" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>What are the different benefits of selling on Facebook Shop as opposed to Instagram Shops? Here are three main differences:</p>
<h3>Market Availability</h3>
<p>Facebook has a broad global presence, so it&#8217;s accessible to a wide range of markets. However, certain features and functionalities within Facebook Shop, such as payment options and integration with local shipping providers, might be more limited in some regions.</p>
<p><a style="font-size: 14px;" href="https://m.facebook.com/help/instagram/321000045119159" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Shops is available in select markets</a><span style="color: #666666; font-size: 14px;">.  </span>Instagram has a large international user base, and the Shop feature is designed to cater to businesses targeting Instagram&#8217;s global audience. Like Facebook Shop, the availability of specific features and payment options in Instagram Shop can vary by region, as it depends on local regulations and partnerships.<br />
Both Facebook and Instagram checkout is only available in the United States</p>
<h3>Product Display</h3>
<p>Instagram has a unique way of organizing the product. The Shops section pulls together multiple product recommendations based on browsing history, and places them into a central location known as “Products For You”.This allows users to easily navigate, as they&#8217;re on a small touchscreen device like a mobile. Facebook doesn’t have this feature.</p>
<p>In summary, Facebook Shop offers more flexibility in terms of product organization, customization, and the use of rich media content, while Instagram Shops are designed to be highly visual and mobile-friendly, with an emphasis on product tagging in organic content.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>The setup process is slightly different between the two platforms. The main differences between setting up a Facebook Shop and an Instagram Shop are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1. Platform and Interface:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Shop:</strong> To set up a Facebook Shop, you need a Facebook Page for your business. You manage and configure your shop through Facebook&#8217;s Commerce Manager. This provides a more comprehensive set of tools and options for product management and customization.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Shop:</strong> To create an Instagram Shop, you need an Instagram Business or Creator account, and it should be linked to a Facebook Page. You set up and manage your shop directly on Instagram, and it primarily focuses on the visual presentation of your products within the Instagram app.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Catalog Creation and Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Shop:</strong> You create and manage your product catalog within Facebook&#8217;s Commerce Manager. This catalog includes detailed information about your products, pricing, availability, and customization options for categorization and organization.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Shop:</strong> You can create and manage your product catalog directly within Instagram or sync it with an existing catalog from Facebook&#8217;s Commerce Manager. Instagram&#8217;s catalog is typically more streamlined, with a focus on visuals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Payment Processing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Shop:</strong> You need to set up payment processing options through Facebook to accept payments for products in your Facebook Shop. Various payment methods like PayPal and Stripe can be integrated.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Shop:</strong> Instagram facilitates the checkout process for customers within the app. Users can make purchases without leaving Instagram, and you&#8217;ll need to set up payment options specifically through Instagram Shopping.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Customization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Shop:</strong> Facebook Shops offer more extensive customization options for your shop&#8217;s appearance. You can add banner images, create product collections, and highlight featured products. This allows for a more tailored shopping experience.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Shop:</strong> Instagram Shops have a more streamlined interface and are more focused on visual presentation. Product descriptions are typically shorter, and the emphasis is on the visual appeal of the products.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Tagging Products:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Shop:</strong> While you can set up a Facebook Shop, it doesn&#8217;t have the same product tagging feature as Instagram. However, you can integrate your Facebook Shop with your Instagram account, enabling product tagging in Instagram posts and stories.</li>
<li><strong>Instagram Shop:</strong> Instagram Shops are designed for seamless product tagging. You can tag your products in Instagram posts, stories, and IGTV videos, allowing users to view product details and make purchases within the Instagram app.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sound easy? The one thing you might need more help with is Step 5.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to <strong>include the correct <a href="https://Suvae.org/how-to-create-a-product-data-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product data within your feed</a></strong> to get the most out of your shoppable posts.</p>
<h2>In-depth Instagram Product Feed Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Instagram has different catalog (feed) limitations compared to Facebook Dynamic Product Ads and Google Shopping.</p>
<p>On Instagram, you can <strong>only</strong> <strong>upload 1 feed of your catalog to 1 account.</strong> If you have multiple Instagram accounts for every country/language there is no issue matching country-specific product URLs to each Instagram account.</p>
<p>If you only have <strong>1 master account for your business you may need to look into updating your feed URLs</strong> to be more generic.</p>
<h4><b>Scenario 1:<br /></b>Your website pulls the country and associated language and currency dynamically.</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">In this case, you can update your product URLs to strip out the country. When you tag your product the URL should load the proper country based on the location data it pulls from your IP automatically.</span></p>
<h4><b>Scenario 2:<br /></b>Your website has unique static URLs for every product based on each country and/or language.</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">On Instagram, you can </span><strong style="font-size: 14px;">only upload 1 feed of your catalog to 1 account</strong><span style="font-size: 14px;"> which means you need to </span><strong style="font-size: 14px;">choose 1 set of product URLs to include in your feed</strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">.</span></p>
<p>Someone mousing over your products in a Shoppable Instagram post may not see the product name or price in their language or currency depending on where they are located.</p>
<p><strong>Use your Facebook Dynamic Ads feed for Instagram if you’re only advertising in 1 country, 1 language, and 1 currency. Otherwise, follow the recommendations above to create a custom feed.</strong></p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in making your products shoppable on Instagram, Facebook &amp; Google, <strong>a feed management platform can help you <span style="font-size: 14px;">improve your product advertising &amp; grow your product sales.</span></strong><br /></span><a style="font-size: 14px;" href="https://Suvae.org/contact-us/"><strong>Reach out to the Hightstreet.io</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Team</strong></span></a><span style="font-size: 14px;"> to get started! </span></p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Snapchat’s slogan is “Share the Moment,” but the forms those moments can take, as well as the ways to share them, make it a particularly valuable social media platform for growing brands.</p>
<p>Consumers can take photos or “snaps” that they send to friends or post on their profile, for instance, but they can also use the chat function. They can experiment with augmented reality (AR) lenses to make photos and videos to upload as an Instagram story, and they can also tap into a range of popular creators via its Discover service.</p>
<p>Brands can use a Snapchat product feed to show up at any time during the journey consumers take with the app. In doing so they may get more attention from their target audience, given most of the other content on Snapchat is designed to disappear or can remain private to a select few.</p>
<p>This could explain why, as of 2023,, Snapchat had more than 600 million active monthly users worldwide, and is <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/snapchat-crosses-750-million-monthly-active-users-8450542/#:~:text=Popular%20multimedia%20instant%20messaging%20application,600%20million%20in%20April%202022." target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to reach over 1 billion in next 3 years</a></p>
<p>The advantages of generating a Snapchat product feed or exploring other Snapchat products, therefore, include:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li><b>An opportunity to reach younger demographics</b>: Snapchat&#8217;s user base is predominantly made up of Gen Z and millennial consumers. These tend to be consumers who have fewever financial obligations, more disposable income and an interest in fashion and other luxury items..</li>
<li><b>Creative options to showcase your brand:</b> As a primarily visual platform, retailers can choose between using images, videos, and interactive features like AR lenses and filters, to make their products more appealing on Snapchat and increase their visibility.</li>
<li><b>Native storytelling venues</b>: Snapchat&#8217;s Stories and Discover section aren’t limited to consumers. Retailers can weave their products directly into these content formats to  reach a large audience and increase brand awareness.</li>
<li>Interactive advertising alternatives: With Snap Ads, AR filters and other dynamic product ad products, Snapchat gives its brand partners several ways to boost user engagement and achieve more conversions that drive revenue. .</li>
</ul>
<p>As enticing as these advantages are, success on Snapchat depends upon finding a way to advertise your products effectively and without your team getting bogged down with time-consuming tasks.<b> Automating the process of generating a Snapchat product data feed </b>is the best way to do that.</p>

<p>Snap Ads are vertical, full-screen video ads that appear between user-generated Stories or within the Discover section of the app. They are typically non-skippable and can be up to 3 minutes long. Snap Ads include a &#8220;Swipe Up&#8221; call-to-action that allows users to visit a website, install an app, or view additional content.</p>
<h3>Sponsored Lenses</h3>
<p>Sponsored Lenses are augmented reality (AR) filters that brands can leverage to create branded AR experiences that incorporate their products, logos, or messaging into the interactive filters, to promote their products or enhance user engagement.</p>

<h2>Creating a Snapchat Product Feed: The fundamentals</h2>
<p>To leverage Snapchat ad products and better promote your products to its audience, you need to first decide:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li>How you want to structure your Snapchat Product Feed</li>
<li>How to Upload your library of products, either manually or automatically</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Manually</b>, which means you enter your product information into a spreadsheet according to Snapchat’s specifications.</p>
<p><b>Automatically</b>, which means using an extension, plugin, app, or service that pulls data from your site and formats it for you. You can use the data from your product feed to automatically create Product Ads, Story Ads, and Snap Ads, and the new Collection Ads with templates in <a href="https://ads.snapchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snapchat’s Ads Manager</a>.</p>
