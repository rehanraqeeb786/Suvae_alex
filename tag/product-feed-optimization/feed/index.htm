										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know a great product title when you see one. It’s that perfect combination of keywords that somehow makes it irresistible to click through and add the product to your shopping cart.</p>
<p>Creating product titles at that level can seem like a mysterious process, or a specialized skill. As generative AI in eCommerce becomes more pervasive, however, it’s possible for any brand to <a href="https://Suvae.org/product-title-optimization-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create product titles that attract online shoppers and convert them</a> into loyal buyers.</p>
<h2>The role of generative AI in B2B ecommerce optimization</h2>
<p>Product title optimization is just one example of how generative AI in eCommerce is transforming the way brands operate. For several years now, companies have been training specialized algorithms on datasets known as large language models (LLMs) that allow software solutions to not only analyze information but produce new content.</p>
<p>Some generative AI in eCommerce tools have been focused on easily creating images for marketing campaigns, or copy for social media. However product title optimization may be the most promising area given the potential for AI to ease the process of developing effective titles quickly and at scale.</p>
<h2>Introducing Suvae.org’s approach to generative AI in eCommerce</h2>
<p>Suvae.org, for example, is now offering <b>AI data enrichment and data classification </b>and the ability to leverage third-party AI writing for e-commerce tools. This means brands can create multiple variations of copy to test and refine their product title optimization strategy, choosing only those titles and descriptions that prove engaging, relevant and have a propensity for high click-through rates (CTR).</p>
<p>These product titles can be enriched by a Suvae.org AI component that can handle specific requests, like making a title grammatically correct without changing the word order.</p>
<p>Suvae.org’s product feed management solution, meanwhile, uses an AI algorithm that takes context that’s already known about a product (such as how it has been mapped to existing fields, for example) and scores it for enhanced classification. There’s even a fallback classification the AI algorithm can use if no existing product context is available.</p>
<h2>Generative AI in ecommerce for SEO optimized product title and descriptions</h2>
<p>When you’re developing an eCommerce product description, AI can get you from a blank screen to a finished draft in seconds. Using AI for product title optimization is arguably even more powerful, because if the title is good enough, consumers might not even read the description and simply buy the product directly.</p>
<p>Effective product title optimization involves mastering a few basic elements. This includes developing titles in such a way that online shoppers will instantly recognize the product’s main features, whether or not they go on to read the full description.</p>
<p><a href="https://Suvae.org/google-shopping-optimization-product-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A good product title</a> will also come across as written for human beings, rather than stuffed with keywords so as to appeal to a search engine’s algorithm. That said, titles should include a primary and secondary keyword to ensure a listing is easy to find online. Finally, great product titles convey the benefit or reason to buy the product, giving customers greater confidence in their purchasing decision.</p>
<h2>5 of the best AI writing for eCommerce tools</h2>
<p>Suvae.org works with all the most well-known AI writing for eCommerce tools, including:</p>
<h3>ChatGPT</h3>
<p>Developed by Open AI,<a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ChatGPT</a> may be the best known generative AI solution and ignited huge interest in the category. It takes a conversational approach whereby users can simply type in a simple prompt such as “write a product title for XYZ brand based on its latest designer blouse” and get a result almost instantly.</p>
<p>ChatGPT’s base product is free but a $20/month ChatGPT Plus professional subscription offering promises faster response times and early access to new features.</p>
<h3>Writesonic</h3>
<p>Aimed largely at professional business users,<a href="https://d.docs.live.net/a13092c8c4cee8c7/Documents/Writesonic%20com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Writesonic</a> promises to help develop content that aligns with a brand’s particular tone of voice and writing style. It can not only be used to generate product titles but longer form content such as blog posts and articles of more than 1,500 words.</p>
<p>Writesonic has several pricing options, starting with a free version to a $79/month plan for solo marketers and small teams all the way to a $99.999 per year enterprise version.</p>
<h3>Copy.ai</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.copy.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copy.ai</a> offers similar features as other tools that help with  generative AI in eCommerce, but stands out for a well-stocked library of templates for writing headlines and one-paragraph descriptions. It also includes workflows to help streamline common tasks in sales and marketing such as lead targeting.</p>
<p>Beyond a free version, Copy.ai’s one-seat starter subscription costs $36/month, while an advanced version with five seats is priced at $186 a month.</p>
<h3>Jarvis</h3>
<p>Powered by GPT4.5,<a href="https://d.docs.live.net/a13092c8c4cee8c7/Documents/jarvis.cx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Jarvis</a> bills itself as an all-in-one AI assistant. That means besides AI writing for eCommerce, Jarvis can summarize content, translate it and explore content via a chat function.</p>
<p>Jarvis also has a free version and it offers a one-month trial of the more advanced Starter version that has more chat models, which then costs $9.99/month. The Pro version offers unlimited queries per year and also has a one-month free trail before costing $79/month.</p>
<h3>Anyword</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.anyword.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anyword</a> has positioned itself as an AI tool for writing social media copy and ads, which could include creating well-optimized product titles for a brand’s website or marketplace listing. It also offers tools to detect whether content is similar to what’s already online and a number of third-party integrations.</p>
<p>Anyword has three plans: a $49.99/month Starter, a $99/month “Data Driven” version that backs up content with its performance data and a $499.99/month Business version where its algorithm is trained on its most successful past campaigns. Enterprise pricing is available upon request.</p>
<h2>Future trends in generative AI for B2B ecommerce</h2>
<p>Generative AI in eCommerce is only going to become more advanced as companies develop better natural language processing engines and further integrate with existing digital marketing and sales tools.</p>
<p>Today, many people are using AI writing for eCommerce software to revise their first attempts at <b>product title optimization</b>. Over time, the technology may offer the perfect copy on the first try, whether you’re using an eCommerce product description AI writing tool or something similar.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Suvae.org’s AI capabilities will help brands do an even better job of setting up product feeds with less effort while driving greater performance and revenue. Whether you’re focused on creating product titles, exploring data enrichment or improving the way products are classified, the time to begin leveraging generative AI in eCommerce is now.</p>

<p>Product title optimization is a surprisingly powerful way to address many of these issues. It helps you ensure customers find the items they want, that they’ll have all the details they need and that your content is ready to be distributed through any digital channel. .</p>
<h2>What is Product Title Optimization?</h2>
<p>Hopefully, your brand is already actively practicing search engine optimization (SEO) for the various sections of your website. This usually involves researching relevant keywords that reflect what your target market tends to look for on platforms like Google.</p>
<p>Product title optimization is part of SEO, but one that’s easily overlooked. It’s a process of making changes in how items are described to improve their performance. By <b>optimizing product titles</b>, you’re ensuring that what you’re publishing online relates to common search queries.</p>
<p>This helps your brand on several levels. From a marketing perspective, learning about Google Shopping product title optimization will drive more organic traffic back to your eCommerce pages. If you’re selling on marketplaces, perfecting Amazon product title optimization, for example, will give you the best chance of being discovered by a large audience of shoppers.</p>
<p>A well-optimized product title also makes intuitive sense. If your customers were visiting a physical store, you’d want to make signage clear and provide enough information to lead them directly to the products they want. The same principle holds true online.</p>
<h2>Product Title Optimization: Examples</h2>
<p>The most valuable customers – the ones who spend more, and spend more often – are always looking for something specific and special.</p>
<p>If they search on Google for “luxury handbags,” for instance, generic results won’t interest them.</p>
<p>Optimizing product titles should take into account the materials you use, the uniqueness of a style, and anything else that might make a search result or ad stand out. Consider the following:</p>
<p><b>(Brand name) Trendsetter Saffino Leather Compact Yellow Handbag</b></p>
<p>In just a few words, this fictitious brand has not only included its product’s name (Trendsetter), but details that speak to its quality, size, and color.</p>
<p>The same goes for other kinds of products. If you’re selling footwear, there’s a big difference between “men’s dress shoe” and “Men’s Italian leather upper tasseled loafer.” In this case, little things can make a big difference – not only in terms of how content is displayed on the web but in product feeds that support all your digital channels.</p>
<h2>How does Product Title Optimization work?</h2>
<p>There’s a lot to consider when you’re optimizing product titles. Make sure you address all of the following:</p>
<h3>1. Study the requirements of any search engines, digital channels, or online marketplaces</h3>
<p>Most brands don’t rely solely on their own websites to generate the online shopping activity they need to grow. If you’re taking advantage of popular search engines or marketplaces, do your homework by checking what they expect to see.</p>
<p><a href="https://Suvae.org/google-shopping-optimization-product-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Shopping product title optimization</a>, for instance, has specific syntax, schema, and structure to make the most of its services. Look for any information that is provided to sellers, like this SEO guide that includes<a href="https://sell.amazon.com/blog/amazon-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> steps for Amazon product title optimization</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Use keyword research to ensure relevant search queries</h3>
<p>Digital shoppers may be searching online without realizing you carry exactly what they want or need. The only way to ensure you align is by using keyword search tools and imagining yourself in their place to identify the kind of phrases they’re likely to key into Google.</p>
<p>In general, the right use of keywords will communicate what your product is, what it does, and what kind of problem it solves – even if the “problem” is adding the perfect garment or accessory to their wardrobe.</p>
<h3>3. Balance being descriptive with keeping titles short</h3>
<p>There’s an art in conveying the value your product is providing without asking consumers (or Google) to parse a significant amount of text.</p>
<p>Aim for seven words or less, or about 50 to 75 characters. As you’re optimizing product titles, ask yourself if there is anything redundant, unnecessary, or overly verbose. Bear in mind that shoppers will be seeing your products among many others. Respect their time and give them a great experience by making it easy to scan.</p>
<h3>4. Weave product variations (size, colors, etc.) into titles</h3>
<p>Customers love choice, which is one of the reasons many brands have learned to offer their products in a variety of styles, colors, sizes, textures, and more.</p>
<p>Product title optimization should take into account these variants, including those where there are none. “One size” might be included in a title for an item that is one-size-fits-all, for instance.</p>
<h3>5. Structure titles by prioritizing the most critical information first</h3>
<p>Some of your target market is probably still shopping online using their desktop PC, but many others will have opted for a mobile device like their smartphone. That means there is the chance a portion of your title could get off when it’s displayed in search results or shopping ads.</p>
<p>To mitigate this, think carefully about structure when you’re optimizing product titles. You can begin with your product’s brand name, for instance, followed by the material, color, and size. Depending on what’s most important to your customers, however, it might be better for the brand name to be followed by the color first, then size and material. Outside of fashion categories, specific product features might need to come before other descriptors.</p>
<h3>6. Optimize titles with product descriptions in mind</h3>
<p>While product title optimization is important, it’s not your only chance to sell consumers on the value an item is providing.</p>
<p>When they click through an ad or search result, for instance, you’ll have the opportunity to provide a more detailed product description on your website or an online marketplace. Don’t simply repeat the same information in these areas. Think of the product title as the cover of a book and the description as the story they came to hear.</p>
<h3>7. Review competitor brands and revise accordingly</h3>
<p>Back when telephone print directories were the easiest place to search for a business, a housepainting company might have called itself AA Painters so it would be listed first. A competitor might try to get ahead by calling itself AAA Painters. You have to be more sophisticated when you’re using search engines, but it still pays to keep an eye on what rival companies are doing.</p>
<p>Are your competitors using the same product title structure for most of their items? It might mean shoppers gravitate to that format, but it could also be a chance to innovate by highlighting a different detail first. Do they use the same adjectives that you use? Maybe you can find a synonym to set yourself apart. Always be looking for attributes in product titles that will convey your uniqueness as a brand.</p>
<h3>8. Act like a “Mystery Shopper” and think through the customer journey online</h3>
<p>Now and then pretend you’re not an employee at your brand but the kind of person it is hoping to cultivate as a long-term customer.</p>
<p>Building on the point about competitors above, do a search online for one of your products and be honest: would you choose your own company’s item first? If not, why not? Do the same exercise on an online marketplace.</p>
<h3>9. Avoid overly promotional phrases</h3>
<p>Words like “stylish,” or even “luxury” might work well enough to generate click-throughs and purchases. Sticking in phrases like “Buy one, get 50% off” in titles is a bad idea too. They could even run you afoul of search engines if you’re trying to fine-tune Google Shopping product title optimization.</p>
<p>What shoppers want instead are details that matter. This could include phrases like “oversized,” “skinny fit,” “waterproof” or “insulated, among others.”</p>
<h3>10. Check for capitalization, grammar, and overall quality</h3>
<p>Not every word in your title needs to be capitalized. Unless it’s not a proper brand name, stick with capitalizing the first letter of the first word instead.</p>
<p>Needless to say, optimizing product titles isn’t finished until everything has been proofread to ensure it makes sense and that everything is spelled correctly. This is also where you can consider the use of symbols, such as dashes or commas, to help separate key elements or ideas within your title.</p>
<p>Remember that your product titles are part of the first impression you make with customers, so the copy needs to be as professional as possible.</p>
<h3>Explore Product Title Optimization Tools</h3>
<p>You may want to establish your quality standards by optimizing product titles for an initial set of products, but in some cases, your inventory can include hundreds of products or more. The effort involved in product title optimization for everything you sell can become a considerable burden. There are some free online tools available to assist with this, such as product title generators, but the best automation solutions scale across your product feeds.</p>
<p>Suvae.org, for example, has been developing a patent-pending system based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance every aspect of product title optimization. This approach starts with identifying accurate, precise categories and product types, and then extracting the most popular search keywords. Before going live, however, users have an opportunity to review optimized product titles and accept them at their own discretion.</p>

<p>Years ago, one sure sign of a brand’s success was its products being featured on the shelves of an ever-growing number of retailers and department stores. Today, success is about finding a brand while browsing the online marketplace of your choice – and trusting that you can order the products you need based on active inventory data without having to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Brands understand this, but expanding through digital channels presents a different set of challenges than setting up physical locations or adding more retail and wholesale partners.</p>
<p>First, there is no shortage of online marketplaces to choose from. Besides familiar names like Amazon or Zalando, retailers ranging from <a href="https://Suvae.org/unlock-the-potential-of-macys-marketplace-with-integration-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macy&#8217;s and Bloomingdales</a> to Belk and <a href="https://Suvae.org/online-marketplaces-usa-expand-ecommerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others </a>are all actively working with third-party sellers. More than likely, growing brands will want to be present across many marketplaces at once to achieve their eCommerce revenue targets.</p>

<h2>Why inventory data is critical to online marketplace success</h2>
<p>Ensuring a great customer experience across multiple channels relies on sending the correct stock data to each marketplace, enabling consumers to see what&#8217;s available for purchase. Accurate pricing and inventory information are just as crucial as presenting product features and an appealing image.</p>
<p>This is why many brands seek out <a href="https://Suvae.org/multi-marketplace-integration-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketplace integration services</a> in the first place, though their needs could evolve significantly as they continue to expand.</p>
<p>Initially, a brand might update product feeds from a central warehouse hourly during the day and every few hours at night, depending on its location. Concurrently, historical sales data could determine the percentage of stock to distribute to each marketplace.</p>
<p>In practice, sales can unexpectedly fluctuate based on shifts in demand from one online marketplace to another. The existing cadence of product feed updates may not keep pace with purchases, increasing order cancellations. This not only impacts customer experience but also jeopardizes relationships with online marketplaces that base seller agreements on minimizing cancellation rates.</p>
<h2>Innovation that addresses active inventory management</h2>
<p>Suvae.org recently developed a real-time system to address these challenges. It allows brands to <b>dynamically manage active inventory across multiple marketplaces at once</b>. This involved changing the architecture of our existing solutions to adjust the way data is handled once a product had been ordered, but not yet fulfilled.</p>
<p>The functionality Suvae.org built introduces a series of dedicated “buckets” that <b>manage inventory data in both physical and virtual warehouses</b>, as well as a component that can calculate how inventory should be distributed based upon pre-defined business rules. Incremental orders could be “reserved” as they are created, for example, but the system also tracks when they were canceled or when the system needs to be reset.</p>
<p>Brands also need to store inventory values once orders have been distributed, of course, and Suvae.org’s active inventory solution added that too. It also includes a module to configure the flow of inventory data across channels and a way to visualize a brand’s inventory by marketplace and SKU, as well as the history of all updates from a brand’s product feeds.</p>
<h2>The benefits of enhancing your ability to manage active inventory</h2>
<h3>1. Reduce your cancellation rate</h3>
<p>Suvae.org’s active inventory solution will provide brands greater confidence that their customers will be able to find the products they want, regardless of the online marketplaces where they choose to shop. This also helps build a <b>track record for increased accuracy</b>, which allows brands to meet the key performance indicators of their marketplace partners.</p>
<h3>2. Complete automation of a complex process</h3>
<p>By calculating the precise stock value that gets sent to each marketplace, Suvae.org’s active inventory solution will also save brands from having to conduct a manual, historical analysis of which orders were canceled or the rate of cancellation.</p>
<h3>3. Gain insight into sales performance across multiple online marketplaces</h3>
<p>While the technology handles the heavy lifting, brands need to maintain clear visibility into the health of their business at all times. That’s why <strong>Suvae.org&#8217;s active inventory solution</strong> also provides reporting on the state of its inventory, orders, and SKUs. These reports are emailed to simplify distribution to all relevant stakeholders, empowering them to make informed decisions about the evolution of their sales and marketing strategy.</p>
<h3>4. Ease of expansion to into additional online marketplaces</h3>
<p>With more third parties opening up platforms for sellers, it will not be unusual for brands to make their products available across a wide range of partners. They will now be in a better position to do so, knowing thanks to the ability to <b>dynamically synchronize pricing and inventory data across all shopping channels.</b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There may be a lot of dancing, lip-syncing, and comedic skits when you scroll through your feed, but don’t be fooled: selling on TikTok is serious business, especially when you’re ready to showcase your products to its vast global audience.</p>
<p>In its 2023<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/tiktok-2023-whats-next-trend-report?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> What’s Next Trend Report</a>, TikTok provided its assessment of what keeps consumers coming back to its app for hours on end: the focus on relatable and uplifting has created a community that is ready to take action. Ads<b> with a high entertainment value scored 15% higher for purchase intent.</b></p>
<p>Having a TikTok product feed is just as important as making an ad funny or heartwarming, though. Consumers need to see products with accurate, up-to-date details before they click a “buy” button. When it’s done right, however, selling on <a href="https://Suvae.org/start-selling-on-tik-tok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok could be an important growth driver</a>.</p>
<h2>Benefits of selling on TikTok</h2>
<p>Just consider the results of a survey published in early 2023 that showed<a href="https://getcircuit.com/teams/blog/tiktok-ecommerce-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 83% of consumers believe TikTok will become the home shopping network of our digital age</a>. This has attracted <a href="https://www.theroot.com/rihanna-is-looking-for-the-ultimate-fenty-fan-on-tiktok-1849613824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big brands like Fenty Beauty</a>, which got headlines for running contests and other marketing tactics on TikTok. Another study found <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/tiktok-social-marketing-teens-snap-instagram-piper-sandler/646930/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clothing is a top spending priority for women using TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>Is it worth selling on TikTok? Yes, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s the third-largest social platform, with<a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/charts/global-tiktok-user-stats/#:~:text=TikTok%20will%20have%20834.3%20million,phenomenon%20has%20been%20incredibly%20quick." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> more than 800 million users</a> (and still growing!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Achieving reach within large consumer segments matters, especially when you’re selling luxury products across multiple geographies. Marketing on TikTok should be just as big a priority as being present on other popular channels, such as search engines or display advertising.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though it attracts users of all ages,<a href="https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/tiktok-age-demographics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the largest TikTok segment is between 18-34</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For brands in segments like fashion, this represents one of the most covetable demographics, based on disposable income and typically high levels of shopping and spending activity. It’s an audience where the marketing return on investment (ROI) may be higher.</p>
<ul>
<li>TikTok’s<a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-updates/tiktok/tiktok-discovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> “For You” page</a> is designed to help people discover people brands they don’t know.<br />
Other social platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, organize feeds primarily based on content from someone you’re following. That can make it more difficult to raise brand awareness among new prospects. TikTok’s approach has become so successful it is being replicated on other social platforms, including Twitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>TikTok also provides<b> brands flexibility</b> in terms of creating effective marketing content to reach their business goals, such as driving more revenue, increasing share of wallet among existing customers, and increasing brand affinity. Marketers can create their TikToks using little more than a smartphone, for example, showcasing stylish products in a way that feels native to the platform. Brands can also <b>partner with influencers</b> and creators who already have large followings on TikTok that point them to their TikTok Shop.</p>
<blockquote><p>Get the Details on <a href="https://Suvae.org/start-selling-on-tik-tok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Sell Products on TikTok</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>What Is TikTok Shop?</h2>
<p>Initially available in locations such as Southeast Asia,<a href="https://shop.tiktok.com/business/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> TikTok has continued to roll out TikTok Shop</a>, which allows merchants to display their products to its community, along with directly integrating e-commerce capabilities for shoppers for a smooth purchasing experience.</p>
<p>TikTok Shop also includes tools to manage campaigns, analytics to track marketing performance, and access to collaborate directly with creators.</p>
<p>Selling on TikTok via TikTok Shop isn’t limited to shopping ad campaigns but merchant-led live videos and in-stream videos. For many brands, however, the most natural starting point will be simply setting up a <b>TikTok product feed </b>to ensure their products are being featured where their customers are most likely to be browsing online. Before that, though, it’s important to understand how your ads will show up on the platform.</p>
<h2>TikTok Shopping Ads Formats</h2>
<p>There are also several options for formatting your TikTok ads. You might want to consider trying them all and doubling down on those that prove most successful after running a test for some time.</p>
<p>Live shopping ads, for instance, are probably best suited for a time-sensitive event, such as the launch or availability of a new product. They will be seen in real-time as people are scrolling through TikTok and can be a chance to answer questions and get a work-through of products in detail.</p>
<p>Video shopping ads appear on the “For You” page of the app, which means they might work well as a way to raise brand awareness among consumers who don’t yet know your brand very well. The good thing about these ads is that the videos are shoppable, meaning people can place orders directly if they like what they see.</p>
<p>Catalog listing ads are probably the most familiar format if you’ve run campaigns through channels such as Google. Setting up a TikTok product catalog allows you to curate the items you want to curate and highlight to the app’s discerning audience.</p>
<p>No matter which format you choose, you need to make sure your ads feature the most relevant items from your catalog, which is where a TikTok product feed comes in.</p>
<h2>How To Create A TikTok Product Feed</h2>
<p>Much like other <a href="https://Suvae.org/reach-customers-social-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social commerce platforms</a>, you can begin<a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/create-manage-catalogs?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> setting up a TikTok product feed</a> once you’ve created an account on the TikTok Business Center. This requires time and attention to detail.</p>
<h3>1. Create your TikTok product feed catalog</h3>
<p>With the “Catalog” area of the TikTok Business Center, choose “Add Catalog.” Enter details such as your catalog name and business center account as well as your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Default currency</li>
<li>Targeting location</li>
<li>Industry</li>
</ul>
<p>Select “Create” to finish setting up your catalog.</p>
<h3>2. Choose your product upload option</h3>
<p>From there, you can begin to add items to your TikTok product feed in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>by entering detailed information about each product</li>
<li>by working with a partner that offers a solution to automate your TikTok product feed. In this scenario, we’re walking through all the steps in manually adding products</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve created a catalog, navigate to the area called “Manage” and then “Products.” This will present you with a template to download.</p>
<p>In the same area, select “Add products” and click on “Manually add.” Click “Next” and then begin entering all the required product information. When you’re done, click on “Import.”</p>
<h3>3. Enter product attributes</h3>
<p>TikTok’s Catalog Manager requires<a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/catalog-product-parameters?redirected=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> nine different mandatory fields</a> for every product you sell on its platform. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product images</li>
<li>SKU ID</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Video URLs.</li>
</ul>
<p>To maximize the potential of selling on TikTok, you probably want to consider the 27 optional fields as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tiktok-Feed-Structure.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16173 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tiktok-Feed-Structure-mni3.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="819" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Choose a storage format for product attribute data</h3>
<p>Most brands have many different products to include in their feed. Make sure you store them as a CSV, XML, ZIP, or other appropriate format</p>
<h3>5. Establish your feed schedule</h3>
<p>Depending on how often products get updated within your catalog, you may want to schedule feeds on a daily or even hourly basis. Remember that consumers will be expecting all your catalog data to be accurate and error-free. If you’re choosing hourly, you’ll need to indicate the precise time the file updates should begin.</p>
<h3>6. Choose a product update method</h3>
<p>If you’ll be primarily adding or updating details to the items in your TikTok product feed, upload the file you need for each one. If you’re replacing your data feed, you’ll need to upload a new one where the existing one was located. Choose “Import” to complete this process.</p>
<h3>7. Group products into sets</h3>
<p>Find “Product Set” within the “Category area and choose “Create a product set.” From there, you can either manually select one product at a time by clicking on “Manually Select Products” or “Use Filters” to make it easier to create product campaigns. Click “Confirm” when you’re done.</p>
<h3>8. Add new product sources</h3>
<p>Although you need to choose an initial source when you’re first setting up your TikTok product feed, you can introduce others later on. This is done simply by choosing “Add Products” after selecting “Product Sources” in the “Configure” area. Remember that TikTok needs to review all the ads that run on its platform – it suggests only having one data feed per catalog to expedite this process.</p>
<h3>9. Edit and add products</h3>
<p>There is still plenty of opportunity to make changes to your product information after they’ve been added to your catalog. You’ll find the edit button by hovering over the product name, which will allow you to make changes in each field. The product SKU ID has to remain the same, however. If you need to delete a product because it has been discontinued or your brand is no longer carrying it, click a checkmark next to the product and choose “Disable” from a nearby drop-down menu.</p>
<h3>10. Establish TikTok product catalog rules</h3>
<p>Sometimes you’ll want to make minor changes to your product information, and TikTok offers a rules-based mechanism for doing so. Just choose “Product Sources” within your catalog, click on the source name, and select “Add Rules” under the settings tab.</p>
<p>You’ll have several options here. You can opt for “Value Replacement” to swap one value in a product with another, set “Default Value” or even “Mapping” to map a value from your file into a TikTok-supported column. “Regex Replace” is a way of substituting inventory details in your TikTok product feed file with a new value.</p>
<p><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/create-manage-catalogs?redirected=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok’s Business help center offers even more details</a> on every step in this process.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that manually adding products isn’t a one-time exercise. Pricing, for instance, will only be displayed in the currency you chose when your product was created. If you use TikTok to sell into new markets, it will have to be updated. The same goes for changes to product descriptions, SKU IDs, and more.</p>
<h2>Why you should use a product feed management platform for selling on TikTok</h2>
<p>Automating product feed management takes away the hours otherwise spent adding and updating items to your catalog, while also<b> improving the accuracy of all the data</b> your customers will see.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://Suvae.org/product-feed-management/social-ecommerce/">Suvae.org’s Social Commerce service</a>, for example, everything from feed configuration to product data optimization and synchronization is managed for you. Flexible configurations allow you to keep on top of changing channel requirements, and you can connect your analytics platform to track the performance of products you’re selling on TikTok.</p>
<p>Though it’s just one of many possible channels you can turn into a shoppable storefront, TikTok’s popularity is impossible to ignore.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ask any chess grandmaster, and they’ll tell you winning a match isn’t about planning 20 moves ahead — it’s about strategically reacting to your opponent&#8217;s moves. That’s because instead of thinking you know precisely what the other player will do, evaluating and adjusting your strategy as the game unfolds is better.</p>
<p>Your customers aren’t opponents, but you still need to stay aware of their shopping habits and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>When you consider the global eCommerce market is projected to reach <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US$8.1 trillion by 2026</a>, up from $5.2 trillion in 2021, it’s clear the way consumers buy products online is evolving. It’s no longer all about going for the sale with your online store.</p>
<p>Webrooming and showrooming are now integral to the modern shopping experience for all retail stores, including eCommerce sites and traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Each describes the modern evolution of the retail experience:</p>
<p><b>Webrooming</b> is when a customer looks at a product online but buys it in-store.</p>
<p><b>Showrooming</b> is the opposite. It’s when a customer looks at a product in the store and then buys it online.</p>
<p>Both of these shopping methods are already happening. Ignoring them might mean the second half of the journey (making a purchase) happens with your competitor.</p>
<p>You must have a strong understanding of webrooming and showrooming, then enhance your overall retail experience for shoppers optimizing for both customer journeys.</p>
<p>Keep reading to learn more about these terms and how to update your approach to retain customers and grow your business.</p>
<h2>The Psychology Behind Webrooming vs Showrooming</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15495" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Psychology-Behind-Webrooming-vs-Showrooming.jpg" alt="The Psychology Behind Webrooming vs Showrooming" width="750" height="450" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Psychology-Behind-Webrooming-vs-Showrooming.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Psychology-Behind-Webrooming-vs-Showrooming-480x288.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Consumers want to know as much as possible about almost every purchase. Shopping in a physical store gives them the benefit of touching, feeling, trying on, or even smelling a product before making the final decision.</p>
<p>Yet, shopping online gives consumers the benefit of price comparison, reading customer reviews, exploring in-depth expert reviews, and knowing much more about the product than has been traditionally available.</p>
<p>The purpose of offering webrooming and showrooming to your customers is to provide them with what they want when they want it. This includes helping them to make a well-informed decision, get the best price, and be happy with the products they purchase.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive deeper into webrooming and showrooming to understand the concepts in more detail, then explore how to optimize both to generate more sales and create loyal customers.</p>
<h3>What is Webrooming</h3>
<p>Webrooming is researching a product online and visiting a retail store to make a purchase. Consumers often go this route to get the best of both worlds — make an informed decision and shop online, but still get the product the same day.</p>
<p>One common type of webrooming is the ‘local pickup’ option, that’s become exceedingly popular in recent years. Consumers checkout online, park in front of the store, receive their purchases, and go home.</p>
<p>However, webrooming can also include deciding to buy a specific product, then visiting a few different stores before making the final purchase. You can miss out on sales when consumers go this route, so it’s vital to keep this in mind.</p>
<h3>What is Showrooming</h3>
<p>Showrooming is the exact opposite of webrooming. Showrooming is when a customer starts the buyer’s journey in a brick-and-mortar store but then decides to make their purchase online.</p>
<p>Similar to webrooming, consumers go this route to get the best of both worlds — but they’re getting different benefits from each world.</p>
<p>Since the consumer already knows they like the product&#8217;s look and feel, they want to get the best price while also seeing what other customers and experts say. As a result, they’ll purchase online and are less concerned about getting the product on the same day.</p>
<h2>Webrooming vs Showrooming: Optimization Tips For a Unified Marketing Strategy</h2>
<p>Now you have a strong grasp of how the modern consumer can take several relatively new routes, from discovering a product to purchasing. The next step is learning key marketing optimization tips to cater to both of these behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-bottom: 14px;"><b>Utilize and Optimize Google’s Local Inventory Ads (LIA):</b> This search engine marketing program allows approved retailers to submit a <a href="https://Suvae.org/how-to-create-a-google-local-inventory-products-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local inventory product feed</a> to Google for shoppers to easily find in-stock products at a store in their local area.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 14px;"><b>Update Google My Business (GMB) Listings with In-Store Products: </b>Ensure that your GMB profile displays correct in-store product information directly from your LIA feeds. Doing this will help showrooming and webrooming customers by providing them with all the information they need to create a seamless customer experience.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 14px;"><b>Have Google Shopping and Google Ads Campaigns for In-Store Products: </b>A showrooming customer may try on a product at your store, then head home to find the best price. When they search for it, make sure you have campaigns running so they find your store first.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s essential to optimize for both showrooming and webrooming, to prevent your customers from switching to brands that offer them the most convenient process to do research and make a purchase.</p>
<h2>5 Tips to Enhance Your Webrooming and Showrooming Strategy</h2>
<p>Webrooming and showrooming might seem at odds with each other, but they’re two sides of the same coin. Consider the path-to-purchase routes your customers may take and how to get the best results like:</p>
<ol>
<li style="padding-bottom: 14px;"><b>Retaining customers by displaying accurate data:</b> All your product pages, feeds, and publicly available product information must be accurate. You risk losing a customer for life if you show a product as in stock, but when they arrive, it’s out of stock.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 14px;"><b>Creating urgency by providing the most recent promotion:</b> Are you running a sale on winter wear? Whether a customer is showrooming, webrooming, or opting for the more traditional approaches — they should always be aware of the latest promos. This creates an urgency to purchase now to get the best price.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 14px;"><b>Building loyalty with consistency:</b> All consumers appreciate a consistent experience when they interact with a brand. Understand why customers choose your store to begin with, then consistently deliver it online and offline. You’ll build loyal customers who expect and receive the same experience every time.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 14px;"><b>Earning more customers with always-accurate data with a feed management platform: </b>Product feeds are necessary for GMB, Google’s LIA, Google Shopping, and many other platforms you may use. In addition, a feed management platform like Highstreet allows for <a href="https://Suvae.org/product-feed-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greater product feed optimization</a> to help you achieve all three of the above tips.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 14px;"><b>Generating more sales by evaluating and improving product listing pages:</b> Your product listing pages are involved in both showrooming and webrooming. Provide easy-to-read bulleted benefit/feature lists, make necessary details easy to find, and take high-end product photos.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are more strategies to consider, but the above suggestions will help get you started. From there, evaluate consumer behavior and keep enhancing your online presence to motivate customers to purchase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s world of eCommerce, marketers are expected to perform at superhuman speeds, much like Marvel superheroes, while facing increasing workloads and limited resources. If you are one of these superheroes you know that to get ahead of the competition you need to prioritize the work that gets you the best results. When planning your marketing activities to deliver the best ROI, product feed optimization should be at the top of the list.</p>
<p>Your product feeds are your most valuable marketing assets to scale your sales on marketplaces and marketing channels. To meet your goals, the quality and relevancy of your product information within your feed should be exceptional to provide a successful customer shopping experience. The saying &#8220;Garbage in, Garbage Out&#8221; couldn&#8217;t be more accurate.</p>
<p>Read on to discover everything you need to know about product feed optimization. This includes translating feed technical requirements into understandable and actionable tasks to improve your product listing results.</p>
<h2>What is Product Feed Optimization?</h2>
<p>The term &#8220;product feed optimization&#8221; sounds vague and mysterious, but when you break it down to the basics, the concept is simple to understand.</p>
<p>Product feed optimization is a process that e-commerce businesses use to ensure their products are visible to potential customers on various online sales channels. A well-optimized product feed helps marketers to generate more relevant ads based on searches, structure ads in a way that appeals to customers&#8217; needs, and control the timing of when and what ads customers see, defined by the seller.</p>
<h2>Why is Data Feed Optimization Important?</h2>
<p>Your eCommerce operation relies on the successful integration and synchronization of product information, ensuring its consistency across all of your platforms and channels. Shopping Feed optimizations affect your campaign success by fully leveraging the number of available offers and by accurately matching ads to products users are interested in.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine a product feed having so much impact on your marketing performance. To help you understand why optimization is important, let’s break down the benefits.</p>
<h3>Top 5 Benefits of Product Feed Optimization<b></b></h3>
<div style="padding-left: 15px;">
<ul>
<li><b>Better visibility &amp; search relevancy<br />
</b>By optimizing product feeds with the right keywords, descriptions, and product attributes, you can improve your product listings&#8217; search relevancy, making it easier for customers to find them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Accurate showcasing of your inventory<br />
</b>Shopping ads require specific product information, such as product name, description, price, and availability. By optimizing your product feeds with frequently refreshed data you ensure customers see the most up-to-date information for accurate pricing, product details, and inventory.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Increased conversions from your listings<br />
</b>By providing up-to-date product information, customer trust and confidence increases for your products and brand, leading to higher product listing clicks and conversions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Save time and resources by automating the product listing process<br />
</b>Product feed optimization tools allow you to easily create and manage product feeds across multiple platforms, reducing the time and effort required to list products manually.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Fewer Google Merchant Center (GMC) disapprovals<br />
</b>Google has strict requirements for shopping feeds. When your Google Shopping feed and website product pages are optimized, you have fewer product disapprovals. This process increases the exposure of your ads.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>More granular campaign segmentation<br />
</b>By providing accurate and optimized product properties to Google Merchant Center, advertisers can segment their campaigns by designing ad groups based on the selection of accurate categories, taxonomies, other properties, or other custom attributes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Master Data Feed Optimization</h2>
<p>How do you begin your feed optimization process? You start with creating a quality master feed which is used as the basis for making additional data feeds for each marketing channel like Google, Facebook, Instagram, and others.</p>
<p><b>Here are the steps to build the basis for an optimized master data feed:</b><b></b></p>
<div style="padding-left: 15px;">
<ul>
<li><b>Understand where and how your product data is stored<br />
</b>The first step is understanding what data you need, where it resides (eCommerce platform, PIM, spreadsheet, etc.), and how it&#8217;s displayed on your website. This process can be very simple or complex. Talking to a <a href="http://Suvae.org/product-feed-management">Product Feed Management provider</a> to help you at this stage could alleviate problems with your product listings down the road.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Outline where (countries) you want to promote your products and on what channels<br />
</b>When you get into <a href="https://Suvae.org/create-a-multi-country-product-feed-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-country and multi-currency product feeds</a>, simple things like the structure of your website URLs, the price shown on your website, and the product information on your pages should align with the channel&#8217;s requirements you are selling on.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Identify the data you need for the channel you are selling on<br />
</b>Each channel&#8217;s requirements may be different. Doing your research to stay on top of these ever-changing requirements helps to identify the gaps in missing and incorrect product data. This step is sometimes an eye-opener for sellers that didn&#8217;t realize they had conflicting and missing information.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Data </span>Feed Optimization for Marketing &amp; Marketplace Channels</h2>
<p>Small retailers or brands usually start expanding their reach by selling a few products on marketplaces and advertising some products on shopping channels. At this stage, a simple product feed plugin to create a feed may be &#8220;good enough&#8221; to start running product listing ads on channels like Google Shopping. As you grow and expand, you should be on the lookout to find a full-service product feed management and marketplace integration solution to free up your team&#8217;s time to manage all of the feed optimizations needed to scale your sales.</p>

</div>
<p>Now that you’ve learned about master feeds and channel feeds, let’s get into more detail on optimizing Google Shopping feeds.</p>
<h2>Important Tips for Google Shopping Feed Optimization</h2>
<p>There are over 1 billion shopping sessions per day on Google Shopping. It is no wonder it’s the most popular search advertising option for both small and large eCommerce companies.</p>
<p>Reviewing the data in your Google Shopping feed attributes to ensure it’s compliant with Google’s requirements and relevant to the products you’re selling, is the basis for a quality feed.</p>
<p><strong>Use these shopping feed optimization tips as a framework to create better feeds for improved product listings.</strong></p>
<h3><b>Top Google Shopping Attributes to Optimize Within Your Feed</b></h3>
<h4><b>Title</b></h4>
<p>The more relevant your title is to what a person on Google is searching for, the better your product listing&#8217;s performance will be. They advise advertisers to avoid promotional text and align their landing page&#8217;s title with the title in their feed.</p>
<p>A product feed management solution allows you to create rules so that if specific attributes aren&#8217;t available, you can replace them with other details or even add a plural to make the title read better.</p>
<p><i>Product Title Example:</i></p>
<p>Brand [blank] Product Name (when available) [blank] product type (when available and not in the product name)[,] gender (plural with &#8216;s)[,] [material])[,] color[,] size</p>
<h4><b>Color</b></h4>
<p>Google Merchant Center recommends if you use a unique color, on your landing page, you should submit that value through the [color] attribute. Google crawls your landing page and matches the color in your feed to what&#8217;s on your landing page. If there is a mismatch, then Google Merchant Center could produce an error.</p>
<p>They recommend adding a more common color name, like &#8220;Red&#8221; or &#8220;Black&#8221;, to your title [title]. These accepted terms help ensure that your products are correctly categorized and displayed in relevant search results.</p>
<h4><b>Category</b></h4>
<p>Instead of leaving Google&#8217;s product category [google_product_category] attribute blank, use it to help create findable products by people searching for them in your category. If you don&#8217;t provide category information within your feed, you run the risk of Google automatically categorizing your products.</p>
<p>An example of a well-chosen product category for a dress is <i>Clothing &amp; Accessories &gt; Clothing &gt; Dresses</i></p>
<p><b>Get more in-depth information on </b><a href="https://Suvae.org/google-shopping-optimization-product-category/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Google Product Category Optimization</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<h4><b>GTIN</b></h4>
<p>The Global Trade Item Number, or GTIN, is no longer a required attribute for your Google Shopping feed but is still worth using in your optimization process. When you&#8217;re running Google Shopping ads, you&#8217;re bidding against competitors potentially selling the same or similar products. The GTIN code helps customers find your specific product listing easier and faster.</p>

<h3>Other Important <span style="font-weight: 400;">Product </span>Feed Optimizations</h3>
<p>The competition on Google Shopping is fierce to get the most exposure for your products. To take your campaigns to the next level, review the accuracy of your data and Google requirements for these attributes. Regularly review and update your product feed to ensure your ads are performing well.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Image URL:</b> Use high-quality images that meet Google&#8217;s image requirements to attract shoppers.</li>
<li><b>Price:</b> Keep your product price competitive and consistent across all platforms.</li>
<li><b>Product Type:</b> Categorize your product accurately using Google&#8217;s product taxonomy.</li>
<li><b>Brand: </b>Include your product&#8217;s brand name to increase clicks and conversions.</li>
<li><b>Availability: </b>Keep your product availability up-to-date to avoid disappointing shoppers.</li>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shopping behavior is changing, and when we researched how it changed, what we discovered was eye-opening. Remember when “Activewear” became the new “Officewear” in 2020? A new online work environment emerged consisting of cozy sweatpants on the bottom and a Zoom call-appropriate shirt on top. Today that dress code and the need for office-related items is evolving fast as more companies mandate their staff back to the office.</p>
<p>As the New York Times reported,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/29/business/casual-workwear-clothes-office.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> Nordstrom </strong><strong>saw a 152 percent increase in searches on its website for the term “workwear”</strong></a> in February 2022. Looking toward the Fall season, more employees are expected to return to work, and retailers look forward to a boost in back-to-office shopping items.</p>
<p>What does this mean for your brand? There’s an opportunity to rethink your consumer’s online shopping experience. The main considerations are your online presence and the positioning of your products. In this post, you’ll learn more about your customer’s back-to-office mindset, their changing shopping habits, tips on how to engage with them, and how product catalog optimization can help you reach maximum product exposure and connect you to the right customers.</p>
<h2>Your Customer’s Mindset Going Back to The Office</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12899" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2woman-back-to-the-office.jpg" alt="customers mindset back to office" width="750" height="475" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2woman-back-to-the-office.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2woman-back-to-the-office-480x304.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In your customer’s mind, it’s time to look good and feel good at work. After two years of on and off lockdowns, employees returning to the office are searching for back-to-work clothing, and it’s expected that as more businesses bring back staff, the searches for office-related clothing and products will increase.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/1502032946445783051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Trends</a> reported that “business casual outfits” and “casual work outfits” searches hit an all-time high in the US back in March of 2022. But new online searches aren’t the only changes related to a workforce returning to the office.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12889" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/business-casual-trends-google.png" alt="Business casual trends google" width="750" height="167" /></p>
<h2>What Changing Consumer Behavior Means for Retailers</h2>
<p>There’s another behavior shift related to where and how people shop. The opportunity to shop online while commuting to and from work and buy in-store before work, at lunch, and after work.<br />
How do you <strong>engage with your current customers and attract new ones</strong> as their spending patterns change?</p>
<p>Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integrate with new <a href="https://Suvae.org/top-online-marketplace-sites-for-ecommerce-merchants-to-sell-at-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online Marketplaces</a></strong> and market your products on shopping channels to be where your audience is<br />
Reach people browsing and searching for products by category, brand, and other factors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promote products in your physical stores </strong>to capitalize on in-store shopping trends<br />
Use <strong><a href="https://Suvae.org/local-inventory-ads-turn-online-browsers-into-in-store-shoppers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Local inventory ads</a></strong> to attract local buyers and advertise products based on audience location.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build better customer experiences on social media</strong><br />
Integrate your products with <strong><a href="https://Suvae.org/reach-customers-social-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Commerce Platforms</a></strong> like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and TikTok. The more seamless your customer’s shopping experience, the more chance they’ll come back and buy more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Attract More Customers, Wherever They Are</h2>
<p>The saying “The one thing you can count on is change.” is the reality retailers are accustomed to. This is why having a solution to adapt to your customer&#8217;s shifting lifestyle is so important.</p>
<p>A popular method for keeping your inventory responsive to these market changes is Product Catalog Optimization. It’s the technical process of <strong>optimizing the product data in your catalog to help online shoppers find your products</strong>, make an informed buying decision, and provide a better shopping experience with your brand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12893" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/woman-shopping-online.jpg" alt="product catalog optimization attracts customers" width="750" height="475" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/woman-shopping-online.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/woman-shopping-online-480x304.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Think of how a supermarket continually merchandises its stock based on consumer demand, seasonal items, and promotions. The same result occurs when retailers <strong>use product catalog optimization to attract customers</strong> to their products everywhere they’re spending time online.</p>
<h4>The New Omnichannel Commerce Strategy</h4>
<p>Your catalog optimization doesn&#8217;t end with the products sold on your website. Whether you’re a retailer focused on selling in a local area or a global brand selling in multiple countries, <strong>your product data needs to be structured properly and updated frequently on every commerce channel</strong>. This practice is a <a href="https://Suvae.org/new-omnichannel-shopping-experience-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">core success factor of an omnichannel commerce strategy.</a></p>
<p>Commerce channels like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google Shopping, Amazon, eBay, and Rakuten need dedicated and optimized product feeds.</p>
<h2>Product Catalog Optimization Made Easy</h2>
<p>Adapting to your customer’s changing shopping behaviors and adopting new commerce channels is part of a retailer’s job, but a lack of experienced resources and specialized techniques can be a roadblock.<br />
This is where a highly technical product feed management service can help. Solutions like <a href="https://Suvae.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suvae.org</a> help you <strong>optimize your catalog and product data for every channel your products are listed.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As leisure travel skyrockets, consumers are increasing their spending on the world’s top eCommerce search engine from previous years. It&#8217;s almost like the back-to-school season, but instead of buying pens and binders, your customers are looking for clothing, books, and anything and everything that will ensure their perfect holiday.</p>
<p>Looking at summer sales on Amazon, eMarketer expects <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/what-expect-during-amazon-s-prime-day-sale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon’s Prime Day sales event will generate $12.52 billion in worldwide revenues</a> this year, a year-over-year (YoY) gain of 17.0%, per their new forecast.</p>
<p>So how do you get your Amazon Product listings optimized so they’ll be found by vacationers with money to spend?</p>
<p>It starts with understanding what Amazon product listings are and how consumers use the platform to find what they’re looking for. It may sound straightforward, but as you’ll learn in this post, there are many factors to succeed on the world’s top eCommerce search engine.</p>
<h2>What are Amazon Product Listings</h2>
<p>Before online shopping, customers that knew exactly what product they were looking for could call the store and put it on hold or go into the store and describe the product by referencing the brand, color, name, material, and any other unique features.</p>
<p>On Amazon, your listing contains all the information on your product page. Amazon does the searching, and the products displayed heavily rely on the data you’ve included with your Amazon product listings.</p>
<p>Basic product listing details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product ID</li>
<li>Model Number</li>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Color</li>
<li>Brand</li>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Image</li>
<li>Shipping Details</li>
</ul>
<p>You provide this information either with a feed or an API specific to Amazon’s requirements.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that not all listings are the same. There could be three resellers listing the same product on Amazon, and their product information could be slightly different.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12609" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Amazon-Product-Listing-Example.jpg" alt="Amazon Product Listing Example" width="750" height="347" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Amazon-Product-Listing-Example.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Amazon-Product-Listing-Example-480x222.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To get more details on how to list your products, check out Amazon’s <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/202073140?language=en-US&amp;ref=mpbc_200463270_cont_202073140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Listing Guidelines</a>.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Selling on Amazon</h2>
<p>Picture the world’s biggest, most busy shopping center with an endless variety of products: this is what Amazon would be like as a physical marketplace. It’s the largest eCommerce retailer by online revenue in the world. The <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1218313/amazon-revenue-development-ecommercedb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net sales from Amazon.com alone skyrocketed in 2022 to 162,360 million US dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can benefit from selling your products on Amazon:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The ability to use Amazon FBA </b>(Fulfillment by Amazon) to store and ship your products for a low price allowing your customers the ability to use their Prime membership to get deals on free or inexpensive shipping and short shipping times.</li>
<li><b>Expand internationally</b> for a lower cost and less labor than setting up global distribution on your own.</li>
<li><b>Be where your customers are.</b> If your customers are on Amazon, it makes sense to list your products where they shop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep reading to find out how your customers use the platform and search around the platform to find products like yours.</p>
<h2>How Customers Find Your Product Listing</h2>
<p>Like browsing in a physical store, the same shopper that was frantically looking for a phone case yesterday could be back today with more time to browse different brands and promotions.</p>
<p>Picturing your customer&#8217;s shopping scenarios isn’t the hard part. To get maximum product exposure, you must understand how Amazon’s platform delivers your product listings.</p>
<h3>What to know about Amazon Categories</h3>
<p>Imagine a perfectly merchandised brick-and-mortar shop where shoppers can find what they’re looking for at a quick glance.<br />
In her ideal shopping experience, a female customer looking for running shoes walks into the shoe section and immediately sees the Women’s section, an Athletic subsection, and Road Running within that section. Within minutes the shopper can make sense of the categories to find what she’s looking for. .</p>
<p><a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G200332540?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Categories on Amazon</a> work the same way. There are multiple ways to categorize your products, and the more you think like a shopper browsing in a store section, the better chance you have of being found.</p>
<p>You also need to consider the ultimate goal of earning the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GGGMZK378RQPATDJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Best Seller badge</a> to help boost your sales. For example, carefully selecting a niche category like “Road Running” in the Women’s shoe section will have less competition than “Women’s shoes,” resulting in a better chance to rank higher in sales.</p>
<p>Choosing the right category is a good first step to getting in front of more customers, but there are more factors to consider if you want to achieve the #1 best-seller spot.</p>
<h3>Getting your products on the Best Seller Page</h3>
<p>Best Seller products on Amazon are like the most popular items at the front of your store that are flying off the shelves. If you don’t buy them now, they may not be in stock when you return. You can find these items on their<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers/zgbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Best Seller page</a> and see them marked with the coveted “Best Seller” orange label.</p>
<p>Apple’s AirTag Cases are listed as an Amazon Best Seller this summer. They became popular when leisure travel peaked, and travelers dealt with busy airports and the potential for lost luggage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12610" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Apple-Air-Tag-Holder-Best-Seller-Amazon.jpg" alt="Apple Air Tag Holder Best Seller Amazon" width="750" height="173" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Apple-Air-Tag-Holder-Best-Seller-Amazon.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Apple-Air-Tag-Holder-Best-Seller-Amazon-480x110.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The orange badge can be challenging for you to attain but not impossible. You can achieve this status if you get the highest sales numbers in a specific category, which is calculated and updated hourly by sales history and velocity.</p>
<p>To help you build your sales and reach this level, you can leverage a few tactics to attract more customers to your listings. One of these methods is keyword optimization.</p>
<h3>How to be found using Amazon Keywords</h3>
<p>Similar to Google, the more specific information a shopper includes in their search, the better the chance they’ll find what they’re looking for.</p>
<p>For instance, if a travel shopper uses the keyword “sunscreen” but is looking for a “LaRoche Posay tinted moisturizer with sunscreen,” they’ll get two different sets of results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12612" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LaRoche-Posay-Tinted-Moisturizer-Amazon-Product-Listing.jpg" alt="LaRoche Posay Tinted Moisturizer Amazon Product Listing" width="751" height="475" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LaRoche-Posay-Tinted-Moisturizer-Amazon-Product-Listing.jpg 751w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LaRoche-Posay-Tinted-Moisturizer-Amazon-Product-Listing-480x304.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 751px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is where good Amazon keyword research helps shoppers find your products. There are two types of keywords to use in your product listings:</p>
<ol>
<li>primary keywords</li>
<li>hidden keywords (title &amp; description)</li>
</ol>
<p>Read more detail on how to <a href="https://Suvae.org/sell-using-amazon-product-listing-keywords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Sell More Using Amazon Product Listing Keywords</a></p>
<p>Choosing the right keywords is important but optimizing all of the data using Amazon product listing integration will give your products the best chance of being discovered.</p>
<h2>Tips for Amazon Product Listing Integration using Product Feeds</h2>
<p>Strolling through a department store, you’ll notice that the same item could be in multiple locations based on factors like brand, color, category, promotion, or popularity. Amazon uses your product data to decide where to place your items on its website. To connect your data, you need some technical expertise in marketplace integration.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for integrating your products and creating a product feed for Amazon:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <a href="https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Selling Partner API</a> to structure your product data to increase your product’s rankings and listings. This API includes a list of your stock and each item’s attributes.</li>
<li>Use Amazon’s <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/202073140?language=en-US&amp;ref=mpbc_200463270_cont_202073140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Listing Guidelines</a> and <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200390640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Detail Page Rules</a> to ensure you follow the right requirements to be approved</li>
<li>Download a <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G201576430?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product inventory file template</a> from Amazon to add your product data to create a data feed</li>
<li>To sell globally, register through <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Seller Central</a>. If Amazon is managing your product inventory, then your Amazon data feed requires a fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) flag</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to advertising your products, following Google Shopping and Facebook’s image requirements can make all the difference to convert shoppers into customers.<br />
In 2019, <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/search/online-shopping-image-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Think With Google</a> did a study in the U.S. where 50% of online shoppers said that images helped them decide what to buy.</p>
<p>On these platforms, the image is the largest part of the ad and the first impression users see before the title text and price tag. In some cases, eCommerce merchants take the product images from their website and re-use them for advertising purposes. This approach isn’t ideal because each ad type and platform have different image requirements.</p>
<p>In this post, you’ll learn how sizing file type, URLs, background, text, color, and many other factors play an important part in getting your ad images approved.<br />
Also, you&#8217;ll have tips on how to troubleshoot disapproved images to get your campaigns back up and running, by improving your Facebook and Google Ads image optimization to get more converting customers.</p>
<h2>Google Shopping Image Requirements &amp; Optimization Tips For GMC Approval</h2>
<p>Many advertising platforms have requirements. Google Merchant Center has especially complex and frustrating rules to deal with that constantly keep changing.<br />
Each product you advertise has to abide by strict product data guidelines related to its structure and content within your product feed.</p>
<p>Image requirements are fairly straight forward but failing to comply leads to an automatic error on your account until the problem is fixed.<br />
On the bright side, the image requirement documentation is very detailed and easy to follow, as noted below:</p>
<h3>Google Shopping Image Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Clutter: </b>Keep your images clean. If there’s too much going on, it can be difficult to determine what you’re trying to buy. The same rule applies to watermarks.</li>
<li><b>Crawling: </b>Images must be crawled fully before the product can be approved. The server may take extra time to finish this process, or certain images can take a few days to finish crawling.</li>
<li><b>Format: </b>Google accepts several different image formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and non-animated GIFs.</li>
<li><b>Placeholders: </b>Placeholder images are banned unless you are selling paint (where single-color pictures are allowed) or when selling hardware or vehicle parts (where illustrations can be used).</li>
<li><b>Size: </b>The minimum size is 100 x 100 pixels, though apparel listings must be at least 250 x 250. The maximum size is 64 megapixels in both cases, and overall the image file itself must not be larger than 16 MB.</li>
<li><b>Text: </b>Google bans the addition of overlay text on images, as any text belongs in the description.</li>
<li><b>URL: </b>The Google algorithm requires a certain structure for image URLs. They have to link to the primary image of the listing, start with “HTTP” or “HTTPS,” and comply with RFC 2396 or RFC 1738 guidelines. For instance, quotation marks become “%22” and spaces would render out as “%20.” Broken links are not permitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: the image must accurately portray what you’re selling. Inaccurate or generic images are frustrating to consumers and mess up Google’s algorithm.<br />
To further improve the performance of your shopping campaigns, check out the full list of <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7380908?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7293660" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Shopping ads image requirements</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10741" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/gsadas-required-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>To convert more customers and divert attention away from competitors, you need to optimize the images you use. Here are a few actionable tips to help attract more shoppers:</p>
<h3>Google Shopping Image Optimizations</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Make sure visitors know exactly what you’re trying to sell<br />
</b>Use high-quality images at decently high resolutions with good lighting. Move the camera at multiple angles.<br />
Make sure the pictures are accurate to the actual product so that they match the color, dimensions, and other attributes.</li>
<li><b>Don’t be afraid to post more than one image<br />
</b>Whether it’s at a different zoom level or camera angle, it’s more appealing to be able to see the item from multiple images.</li>
<li><b>Use the power of editing<br />
</b>Some image editing programs are available to help touch up your pictures before posting them online.<br />
Experiment with different effects and backgrounds, but don’t overdo it. Remember: you don’t want to divert attention away from the product itself.</li>
<li><b>Show the product in use<br />
</b>For certain categories of products like clothing, show off a model wearing the item outdoors or in another way.</li>
<li><b>Test your results regularly<br />
</b>A/B testing is a valuable asset in web design, and selling online is no exception. Regular testing ensures that you will find the ideal images to post on your Google Shopping account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Some of these tips aren’t necessarily required by Google, but they can still help <strong>give that extra push needed to attract visitors and improve conversions.</strong></p>
<h3>Google Shopping Images are not displaying: How to Fix Them</h3>
<p>What happens when some of your images are disapproved or not displaying? Take a moment to review the guidelines and remember to:<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Find out why you’ve been disproved: </b>The site will often give you a reason as to why the approval was rejected so that your business can fix the issue.</li>
<li><b>Make a checklist: </b>It should show the requirements pointed out earlier and go through the list to see whether any rules have been broken.</li>
<li><b>Use automatic improvements: </b>Google offers an automatic image checker to fix and replace certain pictures.</li>
<li><b>Request a manual review</b> if you are unable to find the problem yourself. Google Shopping has this feature in some cases but uses it sparingly as it takes up to 7 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many factors that can cause disapproval, and it can be frustrating and challenging to diagnose every issue.<br />
Consulting with a feed management partner can help you with image optimizations or any other aspect of listing your products on Google Shopping.</p>
<h2>Dynamic Product Ads Image Requirements &amp; Optimizations</h2>
<p>Facebook Dynamic Product Ads appear either in the feed itself, in the right column, or in the marketplace. These three locations have different image requirements related to the number of images required, sizing and ratio. The optimizations for your images can also be affected by the location and ad type but there are also more general optimizations you can make to improve CTR.</p>
<p>Find out what Facebook Ads image requirements you need to optimize your images for better campaign performance:</p>
<h3>Dynamic Product Ads Image Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Carousel ads: </b>This setup requires at least two images and at most 5 on desktop and 30 on mobile. Images must be square and be a minimum of 400 x 400 with 500 x 500 as the standard recommendation.</li>
<li><b>Collections: </b>The image must be in a 1.91:1 ratio, and a size of 1200 x 628 is recommended.</li>
<li><b>Image size: </b>Single image ads must have a ratio of 1.91:1. Size must be at least 400 x 400 pixels, but 500 x 500 is recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the text in the Ad&#8217;s copy, use the following suggested numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Text: </b>125 characters for a single image or a carousel and 90 for a collection.</li>
<li><b>Headline: </b>25 characters for a single image, 40 for a carousel, and 25 for a collection.</li>
<li><b>Description: </b>30 characters for a single image and 20 for a carousel.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these technical requirements, here are some best practices you can follow to better optimize your images.</p>
<h3>Dynamic Product Ads Image Optimizations</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Use images with a white backdrop: </b>You want your products to stand out in the ad.</li>
<li><b>Add multiple images of the product: </b>If you plan to run carousel ads with the slideshow option or to sell the product in your shop Facebook recommends four or more images.</li>
<li><b>Include a mix of images:</b> Show the product from different angles, including close-ups of texture or details.</li>
<li><b>Don&#8217;t include text that overlays the product</b>, calls to action, promo codes, watermarks, or time-sensitive information like temporary price drops.</li>
<li><b>Match the product images</b> for the same product on your website.</li>
<li><b>Form a color contrast: </b>Facebook’s theme colors are blue and white. Choose contrasting colors to make your advertisement “pop” and stand out.</li>
<li><b>Touch up everything: </b>Whether it’s better lighting, more angles, or some editing tweaks in the post, take the time to make your images attractive. Take more pictures than you need initially so that you have plenty of material to work with.</li>
<li><b>Don’t be afraid to see what competitors are doing: </b>Are you stuck or have creative writer’s block? Do some research on what everyone else is doing. Don’t copy everything, but give yourself some ideas on which to base your business decisions.</li>

<p>Does it all sound too time-consuming for you? Getting the most out of Facebook marketing requires putting in the time.<br />
However, similar to Google Shopping ads, there are <a href="https://www.Suvae.org/platform">automated product feed tools</a> that can streamline these processes for you.</p>
<h3>Troubleshoot Missing or Invalid Images</h3>
<p>Troubleshooting Facebook Dynamic Product Ads, especially if you have a large catalog, can be extremely labor-intensive.<br />
Facebook notifies you of issues with the ads in their Ads Manager under the Delivery column but it’s not always evident what the reason is for the disapproval.</p>
<p>An amber triangle denotes a warning, whereas a red one denotes an error. Errors need to be fixed immediately as they may be preventing your products from being approved. On the other hand, warnings need to be taken seriously too, as they can quickly turn into errors depending on what the issue is.</p>
<p>Here is how to fix common errors that can occur within Facebook Dynamic Product Ads:</p>
<p><strong>Invalid Images</strong><br />
Pictures are commonly the culprit in the Facebook marketplace. Much like with Google Shopping images, check the size, dimensions, format, and URL of each picture. Ensure that the Facebook Crawler can properly scan through your pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Inactive Products</strong><br />
Some items may be marked as “archived,” “out of stock,” or “expired.” Make sure all items are active (which may take up to 48 hours to reflect in the live site) and available.</p>
<p><strong>Against Facebook TOS</strong><br />
Double-check<a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the advertising policies on Facebook</a>. Rejected items can be found on your Commerce Manager, where you can also find tips on how to repost the listings. Sellers also have the option to request an official review from Facebook staff.</p>
