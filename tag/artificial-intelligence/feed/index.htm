										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know a great product title when you see one. It’s that perfect combination of keywords that somehow makes it irresistible to click through and add the product to your shopping cart.</p>
<p>Creating product titles at that level can seem like a mysterious process, or a specialized skill. As generative AI in eCommerce becomes more pervasive, however, it’s possible for any brand to <a href="https://highstreet.io/product-title-optimization-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create product titles that attract online shoppers and convert them</a> into loyal buyers.</p>
<h2>The role of generative AI in B2B ecommerce optimization</h2>
<p>Product title optimization is just one example of how generative AI in eCommerce is transforming the way brands operate. For several years now, companies have been training specialized algorithms on datasets known as large language models (LLMs) that allow software solutions to not only analyze information but produce new content.</p>
<p>Some generative AI in eCommerce tools have been focused on easily creating images for marketing campaigns, or copy for social media. However product title optimization may be the most promising area given the potential for AI to ease the process of developing effective titles quickly and at scale.</p>
<h2>Introducing Highstreet.io’s approach to generative AI in eCommerce</h2>
<p>Highstreet.io, for example, is now offering <b>AI data enrichment and data classification </b>and the ability to leverage third-party AI writing for e-commerce tools. This means brands can create multiple variations of copy to test and refine their product title optimization strategy, choosing only those titles and descriptions that prove engaging, relevant and have a propensity for high click-through rates (CTR).</p>
<p>These product titles can be enriched by a Highstreet.io AI component that can handle specific requests, like making a title grammatically correct without changing the word order.</p>
<p>Highstreet.io’s product feed management solution, meanwhile, uses an AI algorithm that takes context that’s already known about a product (such as how it has been mapped to existing fields, for example) and scores it for enhanced classification. There’s even a fallback classification the AI algorithm can use if no existing product context is available.</p>
<h2>Generative AI in ecommerce for SEO optimized product title and descriptions</h2>
<p>When you’re developing an eCommerce product description, AI can get you from a blank screen to a finished draft in seconds. Using AI for product title optimization is arguably even more powerful, because if the title is good enough, consumers might not even read the description and simply buy the product directly.</p>
<p>Effective product title optimization involves mastering a few basic elements. This includes developing titles in such a way that online shoppers will instantly recognize the product’s main features, whether or not they go on to read the full description.</p>
<p><a href="https://highstreet.io/google-shopping-optimization-product-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A good product title</a> will also come across as written for human beings, rather than stuffed with keywords so as to appeal to a search engine’s algorithm. That said, titles should include a primary and secondary keyword to ensure a listing is easy to find online. Finally, great product titles convey the benefit or reason to buy the product, giving customers greater confidence in their purchasing decision.</p>
<h2>5 of the best AI writing for eCommerce tools</h2>
<p>Highstreet.io works with all the most well-known AI writing for eCommerce tools, including:</p>
<h3>ChatGPT</h3>
<p>Developed by Open AI,<a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ChatGPT</a> may be the best known generative AI solution and ignited huge interest in the category. It takes a conversational approach whereby users can simply type in a simple prompt such as “write a product title for XYZ brand based on its latest designer blouse” and get a result almost instantly.</p>
<p>ChatGPT’s base product is free but a $20/month ChatGPT Plus professional subscription offering promises faster response times and early access to new features.</p>
<h3>Writesonic</h3>
<p>Aimed largely at professional business users,<a href="https://d.docs.live.net/a13092c8c4cee8c7/Documents/Writesonic%20com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Writesonic</a> promises to help develop content that aligns with a brand’s particular tone of voice and writing style. It can not only be used to generate product titles but longer form content such as blog posts and articles of more than 1,500 words.</p>
<p>Writesonic has several pricing options, starting with a free version to a $79/month plan for solo marketers and small teams all the way to a $99.999 per year enterprise version.</p>
<h3>Copy.ai</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.copy.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copy.ai</a> offers similar features as other tools that help with  generative AI in eCommerce, but stands out for a well-stocked library of templates for writing headlines and one-paragraph descriptions. It also includes workflows to help streamline common tasks in sales and marketing such as lead targeting.</p>
<p>Beyond a free version, Copy.ai’s one-seat starter subscription costs $36/month, while an advanced version with five seats is priced at $186 a month.</p>
<h3>Jarvis</h3>
<p>Powered by GPT4.5,<a href="https://d.docs.live.net/a13092c8c4cee8c7/Documents/jarvis.cx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Jarvis</a> bills itself as an all-in-one AI assistant. That means besides AI writing for eCommerce, Jarvis can summarize content, translate it and explore content via a chat function.</p>
<p>Jarvis also has a free version and it offers a one-month trial of the more advanced Starter version that has more chat models, which then costs $9.99/month. The Pro version offers unlimited queries per year and also has a one-month free trail before costing $79/month.</p>
<h3>Anyword</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.anyword.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anyword</a> has positioned itself as an AI tool for writing social media copy and ads, which could include creating well-optimized product titles for a brand’s website or marketplace listing. It also offers tools to detect whether content is similar to what’s already online and a number of third-party integrations.</p>
<p>Anyword has three plans: a $49.99/month Starter, a $99/month “Data Driven” version that backs up content with its performance data and a $499.99/month Business version where its algorithm is trained on its most successful past campaigns. Enterprise pricing is available upon request.</p>
<h2>Future trends in generative AI for B2B ecommerce</h2>
<p>Generative AI in eCommerce is only going to become more advanced as companies develop better natural language processing engines and further integrate with existing digital marketing and sales tools.</p>
<p>Today, many people are using AI writing for eCommerce software to revise their first attempts at <b>product title optimization</b>. Over time, the technology may offer the perfect copy on the first try, whether you’re using an eCommerce product description AI writing tool or something similar.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Highstreet.io’s AI capabilities will help brands do an even better job of setting up product feeds with less effort while driving greater performance and revenue. Whether you’re focused on creating product titles, exploring data enrichment or improving the way products are classified, the time to begin leveraging generative AI in eCommerce is now.</p>
