										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us watch a cool TikTok or an inspiring YouTube video and give it a “like” or subscribe to the creator’s channel. Savvy online sellers have learned to use the Awin affiliate program to connect their brand to that kind of content to expand their global reach and attract discerning shoppers to their products.</p>
<p>You could think of<a href="https://highstreet.io/what-you-need-to-succeed-in-ecommerce-affiliate-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> affiliate marketing as a way to introduce luxury goods to your ideal customers</a> through some of the most stylish people and publishers they follow. This could include bloggers, online magazines, shopping comparison sites, review sites, and more.</p>
<p>According to the<a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/affiliate-marketing-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2022 Affiliate Marketing Benchmark Report</a>, interest in this tactic for growing an eCommerce business grew 300% between 2017 and 2021. On average, it represents 9% of marketing budgets and is set to grow into a $13 billion industry this year.</p>
<p>Given that more than 10,000 firms are offering or specializing in such services, however, we’re going to focus on the Awin affiliate program. In this post, we’ll show why this is an opportunity worth pursuing. But first, what is Awin? Read on to find out.</p>
<h2>What Is Awin?</h2>
<p>Formed in 2017 following a rebrand of affiliate marketing firms Zanox and Affiliate Window, Awin has grown into an organization employing more than 1,200 people who work in 17 offices around the world.</p>
<p>What is Awin, though? In a recent post on <i>Forbes</i>, the company’s CEO<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/09/08/the-current-state-and-future-potential-of-affiliate-marketing/?sh=5e528e0ee0b0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Adam Ross describes Awin as a provider of pay-per-performance advertising</a>. Its Awin affiliate program offers a way to streamline the process of working with publishers and influencers who have an audience that aligns with a brand’s target clientele. It offers an income stream to those creating the content while providing fashion and other retailers with steady sales.</p>
<h3>How does Awin work?</h3>
<p>If you’re wondering, ‘How does Awin work,’ the program is consistent with many similar affiliate marketing services.</p>
<p>Awin acts as a liaison between brands and publishers or creators, placing links to their eCommerce store on pages with content that interests its most coveted shoppers.</p>
<p>Imagine a fashion blogger has posted a guide to finding the perfect designer belt, for example. When readers click through links via the Awin product feed about belts that interest them, Awin pays the blogger a commission on behalf of the retailer for referring the traffic.</p>
<p>The answer to “How does Awin work,” therefore, is that it allows brands a simple way to outsource tasks such as link placement, recording transaction data, and managing commissions.</p>
<h3>Benefits of using Awin in your Affiliate Marketing Strategy</h3>
<p>Affiliate marketing not only lets online sellers increase their visibility across international markets. It can also deepen relationships with partners that can drive greater marketing results.</p>
<p>Just look at Polish fashion retailer Born2Be. In its publication The Awin Report a few years ago, the company showed how<a href="https://iab.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/TheAwinReport2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Born2Be was able to offer different incentives for publishers and influencers</a>. These included an “introducers” level for those who brought their audiences’ attention to its products, while “retainers” gave a higher commission to those who generated traffic to best sellers, seasonal offers, and high-margin products.</p>
<p>The result was a 70% increase in sales targets achieved and a new customer rate of 45%.</p>
<h2>What is a product data feed and how do affiliates use them?</h2>
<p>Your affiliate marketing strategy can begin by setting up a <a href="https://highstreet.io/how-to-create-a-product-data-feed/">product data feed.</a> Instead of manually setting up and configuring links to each of your products, for instance, a data feed automatically conveys details about product names, sizes, colors, prices, and other attributes to the publishers in the Awin affiliate program.</p>
<p>A data feed is essential to successful affiliate marketing because it ensures your stock and inventory information is up to date, and that you can accelerate the process of connecting with premium affiliate partners.</p>
<h2>How to create an Awin product feed</h2>
<p>The process of creating an Awin product feed will vary somewhat depending on whether you’re working with an existing Google data feed, or integrating with an eCommerce platform such as Shopify. Fortunately, the company has provided<a href="https://advertiser-success.awin.com/s/article/How-can-I-create-a-product-data-feed?language=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the basic steps for Awin product feed development</a> to get potential brand partners up to speed.</p>
<p>Rather than tackle this all on your own, however, there are organizations like Highstreet.io that can create and optimize Awin feeds that respond to specific business needs.</p>
<h2>Affiliate marketing tools to help you win with Awin</h2>
<p>A lack of experience in working with affiliate marketing services should never be a barrier to taking the next step.</p>
<p>Many brands gain greater confidence in moving forward with an opportunity like the Awin affiliate program by working with Highstreet.io, for instance. Our <a href="https://highstreet.io/product-feed-management/">product feed management solutions</a> and industry expertise can provide value at every stage of the journey.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The adage “You get what you pay for” may be true when you buy an expensive pair of shoes that don’t wear out or book a flight class flight that allows you to travel in style. For most marketers, however, getting what they pay for has proven far more elusive. Brands might buy space on a billboard near a highway, for instance, without being able to tell precisely how many people saw it and became new customers Similarly, a marketing team might invest a significant amount with an ad agency to create a 30-second TV spot that is amusing but fails to grow brand affinity.</p>
<p>The challenges with attributing tangible results to their efforts are just one of the reasons CMOs and their teams are increasingly turning to performance-based marketing as an alternative.</p>
<h2>What is Performance-based Marketing?</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, performance-based marketing service providers are only compensated based on established metrics, such as cost per click (CPC), pay per click (PPC), or cost per thousand (CPM) impressions. Performance marketing also makes sense as more brands make use of digital channels that <b>offer greater visibility into consumer behavior </b>during a campaign. Activity can not only be tracked across a brand’s website but social channels, third-party publishers, and other online properties.</p>
<h2>5 Tips to make the most of Performance-based Marketing</h2>
<p>While performance marketing strategies will need to vary depending on a particular brand’s objectives, here are a few principles to keep in mind to position yourself for greater success:</p>
<h3>1. Diversify storytelling approaches to drive visibility and engagement</h3>
<p>Consumers can get fatigued by intrusive advertising, to the point of ignoring or avoiding them altogether. One way to mitigate that risk is by developing ads and other performance marketing creative materials in multiple formats. <b>Digital ads with high-impact visuals</b> might always be a standard part of your campaigns, for example, but don’t stop there. Work internally or with agency partners to create mobile-first designs, video-oriented stores, and even audio formats that could be used in podcasts.</p>
<h3>2. Align affiliate relationships with partners that reflect your audience’s interests</h3>
<p>Publishers have increasingly become a valuable part of the performance marketing ecosystem given the credibility, trust, and reach they have to large audiences. These media sites have a vested interest in monetizing their traffic through affiliate relationships that compensate them every time someone clicks through a mention of a brand in their content.</p>
<p>Before allocating the majority of your budget to general-interest publishers, however, consider niche sites or even blogs that have a <strong>proven track record with your specific customer segments</strong>. Luxury brands, for instance, might gain traction faster with a more fashion-oriented publisher whose content is more clearly aimed at its target persona. Ask about any contextual targeting you can do based on the data a publishing partner has at its disposal.</p>
<h3>3. Set clear expectations around marketing performance activities</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12122" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Set-clear-expectations-around-marketing.jpg" alt="Set clear expectations around marketing" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Set-clear-expectations-around-marketing.jpg 700w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Set-clear-expectations-around-marketing-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paid social advertising is another popular performance marketing tactic, but it also offers a case in point of where it can go wrong. Consumers might press a “like” button on a paid social post, for instance. They might comment on the ad, or even share it with their followers. There can be large numbers attached to these activities, but they won’t constitute “performance” for many brands.<br />
E-commerce checkouts or even completed contact forms might represent far <strong>greater value for many marketers</strong>. This needs to be clarified at the outset of partnerships and campaigns.</p>
<h3>4. Harness the power of data and product feeds to attract VIP customers</h3>
<p>Plenty of men might shop for designer dress shoes when they have a special occasion like a wedding, but those working in executive roles might need to buy them more often — and be willing to pay for higher quality. The only way to truly compel your VIP customers to click through is by ensuring you <b>build your campaign based on quality data</b> and take advantage of a <b>product feed management platform that can display your content in all the right channels.</b></p>
<p><b>Product feed management tools</b> add a layer of intelligence to performance-based marketing by tying directly back to your internal analytics. This means whether you’re focusing on SEM, social media, or retargeting, you’ll be able to <b>properly assess campaign effectiveness.</b></p>
<h3>5. Evaluate, iterate, optimize, repeat!</h3>
<p>Performance marketing isn’t just a way of holding your partners more accountable. It should also provide opportunities for greater testing and ongoing adaptation of your marketing content over time. Depending on the early results you see, for instance, consider the changes you might want to make in terms of your key messages, special offers, or where you’re targeting the content. Conduct A/B tests with a segment of your budget to see if one approach will work better than another.</p>
<h2>Bonus tip: Find a product feed partner to maximize performance marketing ROI</h2>
<p>To make your performance marketing successful, you’re also going to have some technical pieces in place. These include setting up tracking for data feeds, online ads, affiliate programs, retargeting, and more. Having accurate <b>high-quality data can help you better promote your products</b>. Highstreet.io specializes in performance marketing feeds and offers you optimized product data to ensure strong sales results.</p>
<p>Your performance-based marketing efforts can have a major impact on your bottom line. No matter the channels or the partners you turn to, make sure your brand is ready to perform at its best.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a marketer, are you doing all you can to boost the performance of your eCommerce affiliate marketing?<br />
In 2022, the competition is fierce for fashion brands and retailers to get their products seen online. We see <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/693438/affiliate-marketing-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. affiliate marketing spending approaching 8.2 billion U.S. dollars</a> this year, up from 5.4 billion recorded in 2017.</p>
<p>Today, eCommerce affiliate marketing is integral to the success of a brand’s digital marketing strategy. By integrating with the right programs and networks, you can advertise your products through posts that show everything from basic product information to more in-depth content like product demonstrations, personal testimonials, and strong calls to action.</p>
<p>Some of the <strong>Benefits of Affiliate Marketing Programs</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generating additional revenue</li>
<li>Establishing partnerships with influencers in the market</li>
<li>Increasing your brand&#8217;s reach online</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep reading to learn how eCommerce affiliate marketing has changed over the years, what affiliate networks and programs are available for the fashion industry, and how providing high-quality product information to your affiliates can boost your products&#8217; discoverability.</p>
<h2>How eCommerce Affiliate Marketing Has Changed</h2>
<p>Since the advent of the internet, businesses have found ways to advertise online. While many saw the<b> potential of affiliate marketing</b>, it took some time for the practice to pick up steam over the years.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the trends that have molded this advertising option into today&#8217;s promotional powerhouse:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The rise of social media</strong>: In the early stage of social media, back in the 2000s, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram had just started to become popular.<br />
As a result, affiliate programs rarely considered them and instead looked to websites and blogs.<br />
Today, some affiliates operate exclusively through networks like Instagram, Pinterest, and others. Content creators have also entered the scene, monetizing their popularity and traffic creatively.<br />
With almost <a href="https://www.tradedoubler.com/pl/blog/top-global-trends-in-affiliate-marketing-for-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-quarters of social networking users</a> entrusting their purchasing decisions to their platforms of choice, it&#8217;s clear why social media is such a powerful marketing channel today.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Mobile marketing hit the scene: </b>Back when flip phones and Blackberries with keyboards were popular, marketing through mobile devices hardly existed.<br />
Nowadays, it would be unthinkable to start an affiliate program without focusing on smart devices because of the shift from desktop to mobile content consumption.<br />
According to Statista&#8217;s Digital Market Outlook, <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/19792/global-mobile-ad-spending-distribution-by-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile will account for 50 percent of ad spending by 2021 and finally surpass desktop in 2022.</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>A focus on quality over quantity: </b>In the 2000s and early 2010s, businesses aimed to make their affiliate programs as large as possible to cast the widest net of exposure.<br />
Once advertisers understood how affiliate systems worked, they became more interested in carefully selecting the best quality affiliates, giving them the right resources and support to be true business partners.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Trust has gone up: </b>Affiliate programs and networks were focused more on getting as many referral fees as possible before the late 2010s. They joined multiple programs and often made poor attempts at attaching to any one brand.<br />
Today, trust is the theme, and advertisers want the affiliate program to align with their brand&#8217;s strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you’ve learned about eCommerce affiliate marketing, how do advertisers use networks and programs to drive brand awareness and generate revenue?</p>
<h2>How Affiliate Programs Work</h2>
<p>Affiliation programs involve partnerships between an advertiser and one or more affiliates.<br />
The advertiser signs a contract with an individual affiliate or a network of affiliates to promote their products or services for a commission. Everything from a direct sale to new sign-ups for a free trial is tracked so the advertiser can understand how their ads are performing</p>
<p><b>A typical program follows these steps:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>The business places an advertisement on the affiliate&#8217;s blog, website, or social networking page. A unique link helps track which affiliates are contributing to which visitors.</li>
<li>When a customer clicks on the link and makes a purchase, the affiliate network records the transaction details.</li>
<li>The business pays the affiliate the commission for those sales. It adds up to what is a profit-sharing mechanism.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Examples of eCommerce Affiliate Marketing Programs for the Fashion Industry</h3>
<p>Affiliate programs help many industries <b>effectively manage their digital advertising programs</b>, especially in the fashion sector.<br />
Some popular fashion affiliate marketing programs offer enticing advertising opportunities for brands.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://www.nordstrom.com/browse/affiliate-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nordstrom</a>: </b>This retailer is one of the world&#8217;s most well-known brands with its affiliate network. Nordstrom has a reputation for providing high-end clothing worldwide, from shoes to jewelry.<br />
Nordstrom has a negotiable commission rate that can change based on your needs and circumstances.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/help/affiliate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Urban Outfitters</a>: </b>Urban Outfitters operates throughout the U.S. and much of Europe, providing quality yet affordable men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s clothing from various well-known brands.<br />
Urban Outfitters commission rates start at 2%.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://www.zappos.com/associates-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zappos</a>: </b>Ever since Amazon acquired the company back in 2009, Zappos has risen from its humble beginnings as a shoe store to becoming a well-known name in the general fashion market.<br />
Zappos is known for commission rates of 7 to 10% per sale, and its free shipping and return policy minimizes friction during the purchasing process.</li>
</ul>
<p>And we&#8217;re just scratching the surface. There are <a href="https://empireflippers.com/fashion-affiliate-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many other affiliate programs</a> specific to the fashion industry.</p>
<h2>About eCommerce Affiliate Networks</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11970" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Why-Partner-With-Affiliate-Networks.jpg" alt="Why Partner With Affiliate Networks" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Why-Partner-With-Affiliate-Networks.jpg 700w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Why-Partner-With-Affiliate-Networks-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>An affiliate network is a medium in which affiliates and advertisers find each other and organize business arrangements.<br />
Advertisers add their affiliate programs to the network, which affiliates themselves browse through to find new products and services to promote.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of active affiliate networks include companies like Adtraction, Commission Junction, Awin, Daisycon, TradeDoubler, MaxBounty, Rakuten, VigLink, and many more.</strong><br />
Some offer global exposure, while others focus on smaller regions that may include one or more countries.</p>
<h2>Why Partner With Affiliate Marketing Networks</h2>
<p>As an advertiser, you can find and contact individual affiliate partners directly or work with a network that has multiple affiliates under one platform.<br />
However, the process of identifying affiliates/publishers and negotiating an affiliate agreement can be long and complex. And that is why <b>affiliate networks have been picking up in popularity in recent years.</b></p>
<p><b>Working with affiliates can help you </b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Streamline administrative work<br />
</b>A network can handle commission payments for you and manage accounts to provide daily insights and reporting features.<br />
Individual programs require plenty of tools and practices, from account management to link tracking to payment options.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Measure Performance<br />
</b>You want to make sure your ROI is substantial. Some networks have easy-to-use dashboards to manage all your programs and track clicks and conversions in one place.<br />
See which of your marketing techniques is working out the best to make more informed business decisions in the future.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Quality control<br />
</b>Affiliates typically must go through a screening process to join a network. Whenever you search for the next suitable candidate, all your options will be compliant and trustworthy.<br />
Those who show dishonest behavior are removed before joining any more programs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Do You Choose the Right Affiliate Network</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11972" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/How-Do-You-Choose-the-Right-Network.jpg" alt="How Do You Choose the Right Network" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/How-Do-You-Choose-the-Right-Network.jpg 700w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/How-Do-You-Choose-the-Right-Network-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>There are <a href="https://highstreet.io/affiliate-networks-europe/">many networks out there</a>, and selecting one to operate in can be a daunting task. Here are a few questions to ask yourself when choosing your ideal network:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>What networks in your industry using?</h4>
<p>Look to your competitors and see which networks they use and which ones seem to be the most successful for them. If you&#8217;re in fashion, you want to use networks that are fashion-focused.<br />
Keeping track of your competition can help you <b>fine-tune your digital strategy</b>.</li>
<li>
<h4>How will you budget the network?</h4>
<p>Networks bill for services in different ways, such as monthly fees and initial setup costs. Larger networks might bill based on sales volume generated from your campaigns.<br />
Your accounting team will be pleased you considered these <b>details when setting up your campaign strategy.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>What features and services do you need?</h4>
<p>Look at what affiliate tracking features offer support for international markets and the level of customer support you expect.<br />
<strong>Streamlining your tracking with the right support can reduce time spent on reporting.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to choosing the right affiliate for your business, your choice of network isn&#8217;t the only consideration.<br />
One common mistake advertisers make when developing their <a href="https://www.semrush.com/analytics/keywordoverview/?q=brand%20affiliate%20programs&amp;db=us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand affiliate programs</a> is not <b>providing the networks with the most up-to-date and complete set of product information for campaign success.</b></p>
<h2>How To Maximize Your Advertising Results</h2>
<p>Advertisers <b>use data feeds to better promote their products on affiliate networks </b>or specific programs.<br />
Basic product listing data includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product descriptions and identifiers</li>
<li>Technical specifications</li>
<li>Pictures</li>
<li>Pricing</li>
<li>Keywords</li>
<li>Product categories</li>
<li>Landing page links</li>
</ul>
<p><b>A high-quality feed is necessary to optimize your product data to boost the performance of your ads. </b>To enhance the success of your promotions include as much information as possible.<br />
Keep all data up-to-date, including pricing and stock levels. And be sure to remove duplicate or out-of-stock items from the list — it&#8217;s a frustrating customer experience to click on a call-to-action, only to end up on a dead link or out-of-stock product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the nature of affiliate marketing guarantees a return for the seller, that doesn’t mean that all European affiliate networks are right for your business.</p>
<p>There are specialized networks that only serve Europe and others that are global with local affiliate partners. Depending on your business you’ll need to look at each network to see which one works with your marketing and sales objectives. This post provides a quick explanation of affiliate marketing, a list of affiliate networks operating in Europe, and when you should consider a product feed for affiliate network partners.</p>
<h2>What is Affiliate Marketing?</h2>
<p>Affiliate marketing involves paying a commission to affiliates on sales made to customers that have been directed to your site from the affiliate’s website. Because you only pay when a sale is made, you are guaranteed a return on your investment.</p>
<p>For those of you who are new to affiliate marketing, this <b>video</b> from Neil Patel explains the basics.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="What is Affiliate Marketing And How Can You Leverage It" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ZrSmfo16sk?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://highstreet.io"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>How to choose an Affiliate Network</h2>
<p>Affiliate networks provide the infrastructure for affiliates (or publishers) to get in contact with advertisers (online merchants). These networks also provide tracking technology that tells advertisers which publishers made the sale so they can be duly rewarded. Many networks even offer services to help advertisers manage their affiliate programs.</p>
<p>Choosing the right network can be a difficult decision. Many factors like which industries they focus on, the affiliates included in their network and who their audiences are, the commission, how and when you get paid as a seller, and how easy it is as an advertiser to promote your products. In many cases, you need to check out reviews, talk to other businesses that have used the affiliate network, or test the network out for yourself.</p>
<h2>European Affiliate Networks</h2>
<p>Europe is a fragmented market with numerous languages and currencies. Some networks focus on only a few countries whereas others have a broader reach. It’s important to know if the affiliate network you choose has a comprehensive knowledge of the markets you want to target to better attract your ideal customers.</p>

The Rakuten Affiliate Marketing Network, previously Rakuten LinkShare, is one of Highstreet.io&#8217;s partners and many clients use this network to better advertise their products.<br />If you’re interested in how affiliate marketing networks can help your business strive, and how to get started with Rakuten LinkShare Networks, then keep reading.</p>
<h2>What is Affiliate Marketing?</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A86bPzsN48o" width="700" height="467" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><b></b></p>
<h2>How does Rakuten LinkShare&#8217;s Affiliate Marketing Work?</h2>
<p>Rakuten LinkShare rebranded to the Rakuten Affiliate Marketing Network in 2014. When people think of their experience interacting with Rakuten they usually visualize the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li>When a visitor clicks on a link or ad within an affiliate website they are taken to an advertiser&#8217;s page.
<ul>
<li>One scenario could be a visitor looking at product reviews, they clicked on a product and were redirected to an actual product page from the advertiser’s website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
