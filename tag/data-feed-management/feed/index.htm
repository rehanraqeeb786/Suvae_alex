										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know a great product title when you see one. It’s that perfect combination of keywords that somehow makes it irresistible to click through and add the product to your shopping cart.</p>
<p>Creating product titles at that level can seem like a mysterious process, or a specialized skill. As generative AI in eCommerce becomes more pervasive, however, it’s possible for any brand to <a href="https://Suvae.org/product-title-optimization-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create product titles that attract online shoppers and convert them</a> into loyal buyers.</p>
<h2>The role of generative AI in B2B ecommerce optimization</h2>
<p>Product title optimization is just one example of how generative AI in eCommerce is transforming the way brands operate. For several years now, companies have been training specialized algorithms on datasets known as large language models (LLMs) that allow software solutions to not only analyze information but produce new content.</p>
<p>Some generative AI in eCommerce tools have been focused on easily creating images for marketing campaigns, or copy for social media. However product title optimization may be the most promising area given the potential for AI to ease the process of developing effective titles quickly and at scale.</p>
<h2>Introducing Suvae.org’s approach to generative AI in eCommerce</h2>
<p>Suvae.org, for example, is now offering <b>AI data enrichment and data classification </b>and the ability to leverage third-party AI writing for e-commerce tools. This means brands can create multiple variations of copy to test and refine their product title optimization strategy, choosing only those titles and descriptions that prove engaging, relevant and have a propensity for high click-through rates (CTR).</p>
<p>These product titles can be enriched by a Suvae.org AI component that can handle specific requests, like making a title grammatically correct without changing the word order.</p>
<p>Suvae.org’s product feed management solution, meanwhile, uses an AI algorithm that takes context that’s already known about a product (such as how it has been mapped to existing fields, for example) and scores it for enhanced classification. There’s even a fallback classification the AI algorithm can use if no existing product context is available.</p>
<h2>Generative AI in ecommerce for SEO optimized product title and descriptions</h2>
<p>When you’re developing an eCommerce product description, AI can get you from a blank screen to a finished draft in seconds. Using AI for product title optimization is arguably even more powerful, because if the title is good enough, consumers might not even read the description and simply buy the product directly.</p>
<p>Effective product title optimization involves mastering a few basic elements. This includes developing titles in such a way that online shoppers will instantly recognize the product’s main features, whether or not they go on to read the full description.</p>
<p><a href="https://Suvae.org/google-shopping-optimization-product-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A good product title</a> will also come across as written for human beings, rather than stuffed with keywords so as to appeal to a search engine’s algorithm. That said, titles should include a primary and secondary keyword to ensure a listing is easy to find online. Finally, great product titles convey the benefit or reason to buy the product, giving customers greater confidence in their purchasing decision.</p>
<h2>5 of the best AI writing for eCommerce tools</h2>
<p>Suvae.org works with all the most well-known AI writing for eCommerce tools, including:</p>
<h3>ChatGPT</h3>
<p>Developed by Open AI,<a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ChatGPT</a> may be the best known generative AI solution and ignited huge interest in the category. It takes a conversational approach whereby users can simply type in a simple prompt such as “write a product title for XYZ brand based on its latest designer blouse” and get a result almost instantly.</p>
<p>ChatGPT’s base product is free but a $20/month ChatGPT Plus professional subscription offering promises faster response times and early access to new features.</p>
<h3>Writesonic</h3>
<p>Aimed largely at professional business users,<a href="https://d.docs.live.net/a13092c8c4cee8c7/Documents/Writesonic%20com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Writesonic</a> promises to help develop content that aligns with a brand’s particular tone of voice and writing style. It can not only be used to generate product titles but longer form content such as blog posts and articles of more than 1,500 words.</p>
<p>Writesonic has several pricing options, starting with a free version to a $79/month plan for solo marketers and small teams all the way to a $99.999 per year enterprise version.</p>
<h3>Copy.ai</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.copy.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copy.ai</a> offers similar features as other tools that help with  generative AI in eCommerce, but stands out for a well-stocked library of templates for writing headlines and one-paragraph descriptions. It also includes workflows to help streamline common tasks in sales and marketing such as lead targeting.</p>
<p>Beyond a free version, Copy.ai’s one-seat starter subscription costs $36/month, while an advanced version with five seats is priced at $186 a month.</p>
<h3>Jarvis</h3>
<p>Powered by GPT4.5,<a href="https://d.docs.live.net/a13092c8c4cee8c7/Documents/jarvis.cx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Jarvis</a> bills itself as an all-in-one AI assistant. That means besides AI writing for eCommerce, Jarvis can summarize content, translate it and explore content via a chat function.</p>
<p>Jarvis also has a free version and it offers a one-month trial of the more advanced Starter version that has more chat models, which then costs $9.99/month. The Pro version offers unlimited queries per year and also has a one-month free trail before costing $79/month.</p>
<h3>Anyword</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.anyword.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anyword</a> has positioned itself as an AI tool for writing social media copy and ads, which could include creating well-optimized product titles for a brand’s website or marketplace listing. It also offers tools to detect whether content is similar to what’s already online and a number of third-party integrations.</p>
<p>Anyword has three plans: a $49.99/month Starter, a $99/month “Data Driven” version that backs up content with its performance data and a $499.99/month Business version where its algorithm is trained on its most successful past campaigns. Enterprise pricing is available upon request.</p>
<h2>Future trends in generative AI for B2B ecommerce</h2>
<p>Generative AI in eCommerce is only going to become more advanced as companies develop better natural language processing engines and further integrate with existing digital marketing and sales tools.</p>
<p>Today, many people are using AI writing for eCommerce software to revise their first attempts at <b>product title optimization</b>. Over time, the technology may offer the perfect copy on the first try, whether you’re using an eCommerce product description AI writing tool or something similar.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Suvae.org’s AI capabilities will help brands do an even better job of setting up product feeds with less effort while driving greater performance and revenue. Whether you’re focused on creating product titles, exploring data enrichment or improving the way products are classified, the time to begin leveraging generative AI in eCommerce is now.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a consumer “likes” a post you’ve published on social media, it could be an indication they’re interested in the fashion, accessories or other products you’re promoting. A positive comment could suggest affinity with your brand’s style. The ideal response to any social media post, however, is when the consumer clicks on a link or “buy” button that leads to an actual purchase.</p>
<p>As social platforms make it increasingly easier to manage financial transactions directly through their services, retailers are realizing they can use them for far more than marketing activities. In fact, social commerce represents a huge opportunity to convert and grow revenue.</p>
<p>To understand how to sell using social commerce, read on.</p>
<h2>What is Social Shopping or Social Commerce?</h2>
<p>For everyday consumers, social media continues to be a place they come to share photos and videos with their family and friends. While brands initially established their own accounts to advertise products and direct them back to their own eCommerce stores, social commerce means they are now using these platforms to provide a seamless digital shopping experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/07/18/2915426/0/en/The-8-5-Trillion-Global-Market-for-Social-Commerce-2030-Security-Privacy-Concerns-and-Legal-Issues-are-the-Biggest-Challenge-for-Market-Players.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social commerce sales are forecast to reach $8.5 trillion globally by 2030</a>. Clothing is expected to be the fastest-growing category in this space, representing<a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2022/shopping-on-social-media-platforms-expected-to-reach-1-2-trillion-globally-by-2025-new-accenture-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 18% of social commerce sales by 2025</a>. In the U.S. alone,<a href="https://www.abc4.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/728564235/simplicitydx-publishes-2024-state-of-social-commerce-impact-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 77% pursue social shopping at least once per week</a>.</p>
<p>The first step in developing a shoppable storefront on social media is to ensure you can<a href="https://Suvae.org/product-feed-management/social-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> easily connect your product catalog to social platforms</a> where your customers are browsing. Product feed management makes this far easier to accomplish and scalable across multiple social services.</p>
<p>At the same time, you should become familiar with the unique requirements and social shopping opportunities each platform offers.</p>
<h2>Top Social Commerce Platforms</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11566" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-02.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-02.jpg 700w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-02-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Approaching social media as a brand is a lot different than what you might have experienced as a consumer. You’re not just sharing content broadly to the world but taking advantage of channels within each service that can maximize your social commerce sales.</p>
<p>These are some best practices specific to the most popular platforms.</p>
<h3>Mastering Facebook Social Commerce</h3>
<p>The volume of<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/insights/social-commerce-brand-trends-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> consumers shopping on Facebook is expected to reach more than 64.6 million</a> in 2024, making it the largest social commerce platform. To reach that audience:</p>
<h4>Leverage Facebook Shops</h4>
<p>Facebook offers a shoppable storefront where retailers can create collections of their products based on a theme, such as seasonable apparel.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2343035149322466?id=1077620002609475" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Setting up a Facebook Shop</a> allows you to display your brand’s name, logo, ratings and other details in addition to products. It’s also easy for users to discover Facebook Shops through their fields or via a dedicated tab and follow it and make purchases.</p>
<h4>Use Dynamic Ads</h4>
<p>No one has time to make thousands of individual ads to promote every product in their catalog.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/m/one-sheeters/dynamic-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook’s Dynamic Ads</a> address this by allowing you to promote your entire catalog while also delivering relevant product recommendations to Facebook users based on their interests.</p>
<h4>Engage with Facebook Live</h4>
<p>Retailers have often used the power of a live in-store event to attract shoppers and give them a closeup look at their featured products.<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+live&#038;sca_esv=2a19a3414e05e997&#038;rlz=1C1ONGR_enCA1009CA1009&#038;sxsrf=ADLYWILQUPYLFJsCYdHTWNbSaCLWUA73_A%3A1721660929121&#038;ei=AXaeZtyLB7rgp84PoryNqAw&#038;ved=0ahUKEwickOrg9rqHAxU68MkDHSJeA8UQ4dUDCA8&#038;uact=5&#038;oq=facebook+live&#038;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDWZhY2Vib29rIGxpdmUyChAjGIAEGCcYigUyChAjGIAEGCcYigUyDhAAGIAEGJECGLEDGIoFMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABEjWClDjA1jVBnACeACQAQCYAV-gAYoCqgEBM7gBA8gBAPgBAZgCBKACxgHCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHwgINEAAYgAQYsAMYQxiKBZgDAOIDBRIBMSBAiAYBkAYKkgcBNKAH4BY&#038;sclient=gws-wiz-serp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook Live</a> offers a way to do the exact same thing but on a global scale. Showcase items with live models, answer questions from potential buyers and offer the kind of authentic connection that consumers crave.</p>
<h4>Optimize for Mobile</h4>
<p>It may have started in the days when desktops were still the dominant device for browsing the web, but most consumers are probably scrolling the Facebook app on their smartphone. Make sure you don’t disappoint them by ensuring you’re offering fast page loads and adjusting text and images to display on smaller screens.</p>
<p><b>Feed integration:</b> Facebook Shops and Dynamic Ads need to properly convey every important detail about the items you’re selling. This includes not only names but pricing, images, descriptions, SKUs and availability statuses. Automating Facebook product feed management will render everything consumers need to know in the right format, every time.</p>
<h3>Instagram Social Shopping: Everything You Need to Know</h3>
<p>Whether gazing at photos or watching Reels, Instagram also commands a sizable social shopping audience, with<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/social-media-top-channel-shoppers-worldwide-discover-buy-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 46.8 million expected to make purchases there in 2024</a>. Instagram is also well established as a home for highly engaging fashion and lifestyle content, making it an ideal digital destination for many eCommerce brands. There are plenty of ways to attract customers:</p>
<h4>Utilize Instagram Shopping</h4>
<p>There’s no shorter path to purchase than “see it, buy it,” which is exactly what<a href="https://business.instagram.com/shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Instagram Shopping</a> was designed to offer U.S. retailers. Posts will include one-click access to view collections, detailed product pages or simply buy directly through the app. You’ll need to set up a business profile on Instagram and comply with Instagram’s merchant agreement to get approved. You’ll then be able to tag up to 20 products and shops in a photo feed post, 10 photos and videos in a carousel post.</p>
<h4>Create Shoppable Posts</h4>
<p>Consumers have come to recognize the little shopping bag icon that identifies Shoppable Posts on Instagram, which allow them to streamline the process of ordering a product they want. Bear in mind that they are likely looking at multiple brands on Instagram at any given moment, and Shoppable Posts let them stay in the app even as they make purchases. You can enhance your Shoppable Posts by not only creating enticing images, but adding important context such as sizing, fit or styling.</p>
<h4>Leverage Influencers</h4>
<p>Instagram is a great example of a platform where users are building up audiences that dwarf that of many brands. These creators are also called influencers because consumers pay close attention to products they recommend and endorse. Partnering with influencers can help draw more attention to your Shoppable Posts and other Instagram content to boost your social commerce sales.</p>
<h4>Use Instagram Stories</h4>
<p>Instagram may have originally been focused on photography, but today users can create Stories that blend images, video, text and special effects. Brands can do the same thing, illustrating how their products could be worn or used in a particular context or locale. Instagram Stories are also ideal for conveying the kind of key messages that were once reserved for expensive TV spots, while also offering a fast and easy way to take the next step and buy items.</p>
<p><b>Feed Integration: </b>Developing a shoppable storefront on Instagram requires adding details to its Commerce Manager platform. This includes either connecting your existing catalog or creating a new one. That could be a laborious and error-prone job without a product feed management solution that instantly transmits the right data and accelerates Instagram’s review process.</p>
<h3>Social Shopping on Pinterest: Your Secret Weapon</h3>
<p>Whether you’re decorating your home or creating a board full of outfit ideas, Pinterest is the ultimate way to curate ideas and products that speak to your individual style. No wonder<a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/pinterest-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 85% of Pinterest users have made a purchase based on a pin</a>. Make sure your brand is among those benefiting:</p>
<h4>Optimize Product Pins</h4>
<p><a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en-ca/blog/optimize-your-product-feed-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Every pin you promote as a brand should tell a story</a>. This not only includes visual storytelling with images but metadata such as the keywords you use to describe them. Also make sure to tag across multiple categories where appropriate to maximize discoverability and form product groups with the same care you’d put complementary products on a table in a physical store.</p>
<h4>Use Rich Pins</h4>
<p>Pinterest recognizes that product information should never stay static. That’s why it offers<a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/rich-pins" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Rich Pins</a>, which automatically sync data from your website. This means you can have the latest ingredients in a Recipe Rich Pin, or updated pricing and availability for Product Rich Pins.</p>
<h4>Create Themed Boards</h4>
<p>Pinterest boards don’t have to be random assortments of products. Much like an in-store experience, you’ll provide a better experience for customers by organizing pins based on broader similarities, customer interests and needs. A good example might be a vacation-themed board that includes everything you should buy before setting off on your next getaway.</p>
<h4>Engage with Visual Search</h4>
<p>Shopping inspiration can come from anywhere, but the hard work comes when you need to track down something that appeals to you. Visual search technologies ease that journey by allowing consumers to simply point at an item and look it up online.<a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/article/pinterest-lens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Pinterest Lens</a>, for instance, can drive more consumers to your pins when you have multiple optimized images of your products with accurate data.</p>
<p><b>Feed Integration:</b> Pinterest allows brands to add 50 different data sources, but doing so manually requires many steps, and Pinterest requires data be updated every seven days. This could become a full-time job without an automated feed management solution that can handle this on a scheduled basis.</p>
<h3>TikTok Social Commerce: Go Viral with Your Sales</h3>
<p>Some come for the singing and dancing. Some come for the memes. There are also plenty of people who visit TikTok for both types of content – in addition to hunting for their next luxury item.<a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/tiktok-shop-statistics/#:~:text=More%20than%2055%20million%20TikTok,social%20shoppers%20reaching%2039.5%20million." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> More than 55 million U.S. consumers shopped on TikTok</a> in 2023, either through links in the app or directly on the platform. Now is the time to meet your customers here as well. Here’s how:</p>
<h4>Create Engaging Content</h4>
<p>TikTok first became known for the extreme brevity of its content, as well as a sense of humor that tended to skew towards younger consumers. As the platform grows, its audience will inevitably become more diverse, but the same lighthearted and fun-loving spirit remains. Instead of a hard product pitch, try to develop clips that put what you sell into an unconventional environment, or answer some of the funniest questions you’ve ever been asked by existing customers. If you know some of your loyal customers well, see if they’ll be part of clips that are part of viral trends, such as posts with the #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt hashtag.</p>
<h4>Leverage TikTok Shopping</h4>
<p><a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-tiktok-shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok Shop</a> incorporates many of the features of other social shopping platforms, including the ability to be featured on a Shop tab, in-feed and live shopping as well as product showcases. Of course you’ll have to adhere to TikTok’s community guidelines and TikTok Shop policies to set up this kind of shoppable storefront after signing up to its seller program.</p>
<h4>Partner with Creators</h4>
<p>Like Instagram, TikTok is filled with creators who have mastered the art of short-form video. Involve them anywhere from launch campaigns and unboxing opportunities to clips that let them explain to their followers why your products are essential items.</p>
<h4>Use Hashtag Challenges</h4>
<p>TikTok is perhaps the most “gamified” social media platform where<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/branded-hashtag-challenge-harness-the-power-of-participation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> brands can challenge users</a> to compete with one another to create the best content. Examples here could include clips that demonstrate the best use of your products to bring your company’s slogan to life in a new way.</p>
<p><b>Feed Integration:</b> TikTok suggest brands can create new catalogs, upload products from an online file or use a template. There’s actually another, better way: leverage the power of a proven product feed management solution to ensure every attribute is included and leave your</p>
<h2>2024&#8217;s Trends in Social Commerce</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11567 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-03.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-03.jpg 700w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Reach-More-Customers-03-480x309.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Social commerce is an ever-moving target. As platforms continue to compete with each other for consumers’ attention, we’ll see them experiment with new technologies and introduce features to drive even more immersive engagement.</p>
<p>Given giants such as Meta not only own Facebook and Instagram but WhatsApp, for instance, expect to see further integration of social commerce within messaging apps that allow consumers to get their contacts’ opinions on their purchases. Evolving mobile device hardware could allow social commerce via augmented and virtual reality. Other areas, such as live shopping, are still nascent and poised for further expansion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As peak shopping periods like Black Friday get closer, there is no time to waste. This is the time you should start looking at your big-ticket items and consider how best to promote them.<br />
It’s when you develop ad campaigns with creative visuals that showcase your most attractive offers. And if you’re serious about having a successful Black Friday, it’s the moment you optimize your Amazon product data feed, too.</p>
<p>While the company sells plenty of its own merchandise to eCommerce buyers, for example, as many as<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/259782/third-party-seller-share-of-amazon-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 60% of paid units are sold on Amazon by third-party merchants</a> across a wide range of categories.</p>
<p>The size of the marketplace indeed means there is plenty of competition on Amazon. However, the company continues to offer innovations that help other brands stand out. This includes<a href="https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/digital-commerce/amazon-inspire-shoppable-content-feed-discovery-immersive-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the “Inspire” feed</a> introduced in late 2022, as well as<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/14/amazon-updates-visual-search-ar-search-and-more-in-challenge-to-google/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAopAwc6S05QqiF6tx59ynRjjeBUlHoZxgFVPDyh7Z9mgcElKZRbY3YbWanzF3xmDZjmX5PvqKyyOE3zAUqBg_qbytNeeGsx5BySP_4MBE3vVukgpOzDzzzYkZlHa9p33petYoOtCAfbVhfMvhGna2gOJ-UleoqYW23WcOSPRIXr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> product discovery tools</a> based on augmented reality and<a href="https://Suvae.org/using-visual-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> visual search</a>.</p>
<h2>How to better list your products on Amazon Marketplace</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16372" title="Listing Products on Amazon Marketplace" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/amazon-list.jpg" alt="Products on Amazon Marketplace" width="750" height="500" /></p>
<p>Much like other online marketplaces,<a href="https://Suvae.org/amazon-product-listings-all-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> getting products listed on Amazon</a> involves some basic steps.</p>
<p>You’ll need to choose the appropriate product category,<a href="https://Suvae.org/your-ultimate-guide-to-amazon-pricing-strategy-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> determine your pricing strategy</a>, select a<a href="https://Suvae.org/amazon-fba-inventory-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> fulfillment</a> method, and use keywords Amazon visitors will likely key into the search bar.</p>
<p>Some of these steps will involve some manual effort, but to scale effectively and maximize your eCommerce sales opportunities, you’ll also want to harness the power of automation for your Amazon product data feeds.</p>
<h2>Benefits of having an optimized Amazon product data feed</h2>
<p>Amazon’s marketplace customers have the same expectations as those who discover your brand through your website or any other channel. They want to see accurate product listings, up to date, and reflect what’s available for purchase.</p>
<p>As you begin to list more products on Amazon, however, maintaining the quality of your data can become incredibly difficult. Updating pricing, available inventory, and other aspects of hundreds of listings or more isn’t a great use of employees’ time.</p>
<p>Beyond taking those chores away, the benefits of automating your Amazon product data feeds include:</p>
<h3>1. Listings that do your products justice</h3>
<p>When consumers walk into a physical store, you only get one chance to make a first impression. That’s why retailers often put out their best products on a table or rack where discerning customers can notice all the key details.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to online product listings. Your Amazon product data feed should be optimized to ensure you’re providing everything from product titles, descriptions, and images that convert visitors into buyers.</p>
<h3>2. Product information customers can trust</h3>
<p>Without automation, an Amazon product data feed might only be updated once every few days. That poses a risk that customers will not realize the price of an item they’re considering has changed, or that it’s temporarily out of stock.</p>
<p>Your goal should be to provide real-time updates that reflect the current state of every product in your inventory. That way, you can more easily offer promotions and discounts that drive more activity during periods like Black Friday.</p>
<h3>3. Can’t-miss visibility in Amazon search results</h3>
<p>Much like when they’re looking up information on Google, many consumers probably don’t want to go past the first page of results when they’re searching on Amazon.</p>
<p>When you put in the work upfront to research the right keywords, an Amazon product data feed will maximize the likelihood your items will rank higher than competitors. And of course, with its one-click buy button, Amazon makes it easy for customers to take the next step when they find what they want.</p>
<h3>4. Access to a global market</h3>
<p>Unlike the limitations of a physical storefront, eCommerce allows sellers to transcend borders and other geographic boundaries. This is especially true on Amazon, which enjoys<a href="https://www.blankspace.eu/blog-posts-en/amazon-marketplaces-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> billions in sales in markets such as the U.K., Germany, and Japan</a>.</p>
<p>No matter where they’re based, though, your customers should have a consistent experience in terms of the level of detail and timeliness of the data in your listings. Automating your product feed on Amazon will ensure that, even if the same customer decides to browse across more than one Amazon regional site.</p>
<h3>5. An end to constant inventory worries</h3>
<p>It may sound like a nice problem to have, but when a product proves more popular than expected there can be more disappointed customers than those feeling satisfied. Running out of stock can hurt your reputation as a brand, both with customers and Amazon itself (more on that later in this post).</p>
<p>Think of your product data feed as a trusted assistant who makes managing inventory levels both easy and efficient. Stock getting low? You can set an alert to be notified and take action before it’s too late.</p>
<h3>6. Out-price the competition</h3>
<p>Depending on the product category, there may be little to truly differentiate your brand from your rivals, other than what you’re asking customers to pay.</p>
<p>Instead of treating this as a race to the bottom in terms of revenue, however, you can use Amazon’s Repricing tool or your analytics to determine what will make the most sense for your business.</p>
<p>Then, when you’re ready, you can use your Amazon product data feed to get new prices up with speed, especially amid moments like Black Friday when you know there are likely a lot of people browsing the marketplace for a deal.</p>
<h3>7. A stronger partnership with Amazon</h3>
<p>Amazon has to manage a slew of seller relationships, and its priority is understandably to ensure its marketplace meets the highest quality standards.</p>
<p>If your listings aren’t properly formatted, for example, or are missing key attributes, it can jeopardize your brand’s future in Amazon’s marketplace.</p>
<p>This is another example of where relying on manual, human effort doesn’t make sense. A product data feed optimized for Amazon reduces the risk of errors. That not only means you’ll avoid being suspended from Amazon’s marketplace program; you could become one of its most trusted eCommerce partners.</p>
<h3>8. Greater capabilities to execute data-driven decision-making</h3>
<p>Amazon wants its sellers to share its customer-obsessed approach to eCommerce. That’s why the company offers analytics tools that let them track their performance. Having the data is only the first step, though.</p>
<p>As you get a better understanding of what’s selling and why, you can begin to make tweaks to your listings that will supercharge your conversion rate. It might be adding more details to a single product listing, offering a promotion based on a possible best-seller or simply ensuring you hold onto the right level of inventory for seasonal products.</p>
<h3>9. An accelerated path to eCommerce expansion</h3>
<p>Creating an Amazon product data feed isn’t an isolated IT project that takes up time and resources. It represents the beginning of a multi-channel sales strategy that can continue to offer dividends.</p>
<p>With your product data optimized, for instance, you can begin to look at other digital channels that are likely to attract your target customers.</p>
<p>This can include<a href="https://Suvae.org/tiktok-product-feeds-for-stronger-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> social media channels like TikTok</a>, for instance, or even one of the growing number of online marketplaces being offered by brands that are already household names, such as<a href="https://Suvae.org/unlock-the-potential-of-macys-marketplace-with-integration-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s</a>.</p>
<h3>10. A customer experience that builds brand loyalty</h3>
<p>Customers who initially discover your brand on Amazon’s marketplace may decide to visit your website to learn more. They might pay greater attention when your products show up on Instagram or Facebook. Some will even opt-in to receive your e-mail newsletter for additional promotions and discounts.</p>
<p>The product data feed you set up on Amazon will let you build a relationship with these customers based on a positive experience, where they find what they want and get it sent their way. When they’re satisfied, it’s not just Amazon that benefits – your brand will too.</p>
<h2>How to create an Amazon product data feed</h2>
<p>Setting up an Amazon product data field involves the following:</p>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Open an Amazon seller central account so you have access to send your product data feed to the marketplace. You’ll need to provide a credit card, tax identification information, and basic business information such as your business name, address, and contact details.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Link your business bank account to your brand’s Amazon seller account.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Choose the local marketplaces Amazon operates that are most relevant to your business in terms of your target customers.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Choose your preferred billing plan – unless you’re selling as an individual this will be a professional plan aimed at corporate entities for a nominal monthly fee.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Complete your tax interview – Amazon needs to verify the professional status of your business.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Enter basic product information – This is where you can clarify whether you’re the manufacturer of the products you’re selling or whether you’re reselling on an OEM’s behalf. You’ll also quantify the volume of products you’ll be selling on Amazon and whether or not you use UPC codes for your products.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Add all the necessary data attributes such as product title, category, SKU, price, images, and URL of each item. Don’t forget critical details such as shipping costs if you’re not using Amazon’s fulfillment service. Be as detailed as possible to provide the best experience for Amazon customers.</li>
<li>Upload your inventory file: Within your Amazon seller account you’ll visit the inventory page and deliver the content in either text or XML format.</li>
</ol>
<p>Be prepared to make changes to this feed as you manage your stock levels, customer demand, and many other factors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There may be a lot of dancing, lip-syncing, and comedic skits when you scroll through your feed, but don’t be fooled: selling on TikTok is serious business, especially when you’re ready to showcase your products to its vast global audience.</p>
<p>In its 2023<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/tiktok-2023-whats-next-trend-report?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> What’s Next Trend Report</a>, TikTok provided its assessment of what keeps consumers coming back to its app for hours on end: the focus on relatable and uplifting has created a community that is ready to take action. Ads<b> with a high entertainment value scored 15% higher for purchase intent.</b></p>
<p>Having a TikTok product feed is just as important as making an ad funny or heartwarming, though. Consumers need to see products with accurate, up-to-date details before they click a “buy” button. When it’s done right, however, selling on <a href="https://Suvae.org/start-selling-on-tik-tok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok could be an important growth driver</a>.</p>
<h2>Benefits of selling on TikTok</h2>
<p>Just consider the results of a survey published in early 2023 that showed<a href="https://getcircuit.com/teams/blog/tiktok-ecommerce-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 83% of consumers believe TikTok will become the home shopping network of our digital age</a>. This has attracted <a href="https://www.theroot.com/rihanna-is-looking-for-the-ultimate-fenty-fan-on-tiktok-1849613824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big brands like Fenty Beauty</a>, which got headlines for running contests and other marketing tactics on TikTok. Another study found <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/tiktok-social-marketing-teens-snap-instagram-piper-sandler/646930/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clothing is a top spending priority for women using TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>Is it worth selling on TikTok? Yes, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s the third-largest social platform, with<a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/charts/global-tiktok-user-stats/#:~:text=TikTok%20will%20have%20834.3%20million,phenomenon%20has%20been%20incredibly%20quick." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> more than 800 million users</a> (and still growing!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Achieving reach within large consumer segments matters, especially when you’re selling luxury products across multiple geographies. Marketing on TikTok should be just as big a priority as being present on other popular channels, such as search engines or display advertising.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though it attracts users of all ages,<a href="https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/tiktok-age-demographics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the largest TikTok segment is between 18-34</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For brands in segments like fashion, this represents one of the most covetable demographics, based on disposable income and typically high levels of shopping and spending activity. It’s an audience where the marketing return on investment (ROI) may be higher.</p>
<ul>
<li>TikTok’s<a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-updates/tiktok/tiktok-discovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> “For You” page</a> is designed to help people discover people brands they don’t know.<br />
Other social platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, organize feeds primarily based on content from someone you’re following. That can make it more difficult to raise brand awareness among new prospects. TikTok’s approach has become so successful it is being replicated on other social platforms, including Twitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>TikTok also provides<b> brands flexibility</b> in terms of creating effective marketing content to reach their business goals, such as driving more revenue, increasing share of wallet among existing customers, and increasing brand affinity. Marketers can create their TikToks using little more than a smartphone, for example, showcasing stylish products in a way that feels native to the platform. Brands can also <b>partner with influencers</b> and creators who already have large followings on TikTok that point them to their TikTok Shop.</p>
<blockquote><p>Get the Details on <a href="https://Suvae.org/start-selling-on-tik-tok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Sell Products on TikTok</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>What Is TikTok Shop?</h2>
<p>Initially available in locations such as Southeast Asia,<a href="https://shop.tiktok.com/business/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> TikTok has continued to roll out TikTok Shop</a>, which allows merchants to display their products to its community, along with directly integrating e-commerce capabilities for shoppers for a smooth purchasing experience.</p>
<p>TikTok Shop also includes tools to manage campaigns, analytics to track marketing performance, and access to collaborate directly with creators.</p>
<p>Selling on TikTok via TikTok Shop isn’t limited to shopping ad campaigns but merchant-led live videos and in-stream videos. For many brands, however, the most natural starting point will be simply setting up a <b>TikTok product feed </b>to ensure their products are being featured where their customers are most likely to be browsing online. Before that, though, it’s important to understand how your ads will show up on the platform.</p>
<h2>TikTok Shopping Ads Formats</h2>
<p>There are also several options for formatting your TikTok ads. You might want to consider trying them all and doubling down on those that prove most successful after running a test for some time.</p>
<p>Live shopping ads, for instance, are probably best suited for a time-sensitive event, such as the launch or availability of a new product. They will be seen in real-time as people are scrolling through TikTok and can be a chance to answer questions and get a work-through of products in detail.</p>
<p>Video shopping ads appear on the “For You” page of the app, which means they might work well as a way to raise brand awareness among consumers who don’t yet know your brand very well. The good thing about these ads is that the videos are shoppable, meaning people can place orders directly if they like what they see.</p>
<p>Catalog listing ads are probably the most familiar format if you’ve run campaigns through channels such as Google. Setting up a TikTok product catalog allows you to curate the items you want to curate and highlight to the app’s discerning audience.</p>
<p>No matter which format you choose, you need to make sure your ads feature the most relevant items from your catalog, which is where a TikTok product feed comes in.</p>
<h2>How To Create A TikTok Product Feed</h2>
<p>Much like other <a href="https://Suvae.org/reach-customers-social-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social commerce platforms</a>, you can begin<a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/create-manage-catalogs?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> setting up a TikTok product feed</a> once you’ve created an account on the TikTok Business Center. This requires time and attention to detail.</p>
<h3>1. Create your TikTok product feed catalog</h3>
<p>With the “Catalog” area of the TikTok Business Center, choose “Add Catalog.” Enter details such as your catalog name and business center account as well as your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Default currency</li>
<li>Targeting location</li>
<li>Industry</li>
</ul>
<p>Select “Create” to finish setting up your catalog.</p>
<h3>2. Choose your product upload option</h3>
<p>From there, you can begin to add items to your TikTok product feed in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>by entering detailed information about each product</li>
<li>by working with a partner that offers a solution to automate your TikTok product feed. In this scenario, we’re walking through all the steps in manually adding products</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve created a catalog, navigate to the area called “Manage” and then “Products.” This will present you with a template to download.</p>
<p>In the same area, select “Add products” and click on “Manually add.” Click “Next” and then begin entering all the required product information. When you’re done, click on “Import.”</p>
<h3>3. Enter product attributes</h3>
<p>TikTok’s Catalog Manager requires<a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/catalog-product-parameters?redirected=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> nine different mandatory fields</a> for every product you sell on its platform. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product images</li>
<li>SKU ID</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Video URLs.</li>
</ul>
<p>To maximize the potential of selling on TikTok, you probably want to consider the 27 optional fields as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tiktok-Feed-Structure.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16173 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tiktok-Feed-Structure-mni3.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="819" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Choose a storage format for product attribute data</h3>
<p>Most brands have many different products to include in their feed. Make sure you store them as a CSV, XML, ZIP, or other appropriate format</p>
<h3>5. Establish your feed schedule</h3>
<p>Depending on how often products get updated within your catalog, you may want to schedule feeds on a daily or even hourly basis. Remember that consumers will be expecting all your catalog data to be accurate and error-free. If you’re choosing hourly, you’ll need to indicate the precise time the file updates should begin.</p>
<h3>6. Choose a product update method</h3>
<p>If you’ll be primarily adding or updating details to the items in your TikTok product feed, upload the file you need for each one. If you’re replacing your data feed, you’ll need to upload a new one where the existing one was located. Choose “Import” to complete this process.</p>
<h3>7. Group products into sets</h3>
<p>Find “Product Set” within the “Category area and choose “Create a product set.” From there, you can either manually select one product at a time by clicking on “Manually Select Products” or “Use Filters” to make it easier to create product campaigns. Click “Confirm” when you’re done.</p>
<h3>8. Add new product sources</h3>
<p>Although you need to choose an initial source when you’re first setting up your TikTok product feed, you can introduce others later on. This is done simply by choosing “Add Products” after selecting “Product Sources” in the “Configure” area. Remember that TikTok needs to review all the ads that run on its platform – it suggests only having one data feed per catalog to expedite this process.</p>
<h3>9. Edit and add products</h3>
<p>There is still plenty of opportunity to make changes to your product information after they’ve been added to your catalog. You’ll find the edit button by hovering over the product name, which will allow you to make changes in each field. The product SKU ID has to remain the same, however. If you need to delete a product because it has been discontinued or your brand is no longer carrying it, click a checkmark next to the product and choose “Disable” from a nearby drop-down menu.</p>
<h3>10. Establish TikTok product catalog rules</h3>
<p>Sometimes you’ll want to make minor changes to your product information, and TikTok offers a rules-based mechanism for doing so. Just choose “Product Sources” within your catalog, click on the source name, and select “Add Rules” under the settings tab.</p>
<p>You’ll have several options here. You can opt for “Value Replacement” to swap one value in a product with another, set “Default Value” or even “Mapping” to map a value from your file into a TikTok-supported column. “Regex Replace” is a way of substituting inventory details in your TikTok product feed file with a new value.</p>
<p><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/create-manage-catalogs?redirected=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok’s Business help center offers even more details</a> on every step in this process.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that manually adding products isn’t a one-time exercise. Pricing, for instance, will only be displayed in the currency you chose when your product was created. If you use TikTok to sell into new markets, it will have to be updated. The same goes for changes to product descriptions, SKU IDs, and more.</p>
<h2>Why you should use a product feed management platform for selling on TikTok</h2>
<p>Automating product feed management takes away the hours otherwise spent adding and updating items to your catalog, while also<b> improving the accuracy of all the data</b> your customers will see.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://Suvae.org/product-feed-management/social-ecommerce/">Suvae.org’s Social Commerce service</a>, for example, everything from feed configuration to product data optimization and synchronization is managed for you. Flexible configurations allow you to keep on top of changing channel requirements, and you can connect your analytics platform to track the performance of products you’re selling on TikTok.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know the “e” in eCommerce stands for “electronic,” but the word “easy” would make sense too.<br />
It should be easy for consumers to find the products they covet. They also want an easy way to discover the best deals.</p>
<p>For the brands, meanwhile, an easier approach to addressing those needs allows you to grow. The business case for data feed management, therefore, is a pretty easy one to make.</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing concerns about the state of the global economy, for example, recent data suggests consumer spending online shows no signs of slowing down.<br />
In the U.S. alone<a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2022/11/10/adobe-analytics-early-holiday-spending-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> there was a more than 10% increase in eCommerce activity totaling US$72 billion</a> in October. Some categories are seeing buying activity skyrocket, such as a 142% jump in outerwear apparel.</p>
<p>According to other research, however,<a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/state-of-ecommerce-pandemic/#toc-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the surge in eCommerce sales comes with new challenges</a>. These not only include supply chain woes but also the cost to acquire and keep customers.<br />
That may be because brands have to balance providing the best products at the best price while ensuring they show up in all the myriad channels their target customers might be browsing.</p>
<p><strong>Data feed management technology</strong> speaks directly to these eCommerce hurdles and is the best way to begin overcoming them.</p>
<h2>What is Data Feed Management?</h2>
<p>By facilitating the distribution and management of product listings, <strong>data feed management helps online sellers</strong> transform everything from how they monitor their inventory to the level of personalized advertising they can bring to their customer experience.</p>
<p>The<b> best data feed management platform</b> should not only <b>allow you to populate all the necessary digital channels with your product listings</b> but also synchronize them to ease the process of updating or making changes to them.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Data Feed Optimization</h2>
<p>Why is data optimization important? Because you never get a second chance to make a first impression – including the impression you make with a digital ad.</p>
<p>When consumers type a search into Google, for instance, they may only spend a few seconds deciding whether the ad that comes up in response is worth a click.<br />
The quality of the elements that make up that ad – the title, the description, the price, the category, and the availability are just some of the factors that will convince them to buy from you, one way or the other.</p>
<p>Providing that data can vary significantly from one digital channel to the next. This can mean considerable work for those behind the scenes to tailor product feeds for every affiliate network, marketplace, or comparison site available to them.</p>
<h2>How Product Data Feeds can help</h2>
<p><b>Optimizing product data feeds puts you in a position to sell anywhere your customers are</b> searching for their next purchase. Instead of worrying about the unique requirements for each channel, data feed management allows you to <strong>focus on creating ads that are more creative and compelling</strong> to entice a greater number of purchases.</p>
<p>Creating product data feeds can also avoid manually exporting your product catalog and creating a disconnect between the products customers want and <a href="https://Suvae.org/inventory-management-tools-for-multichannel-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what you have in stock</a>.<br />
The greater consumers’ confidence in the accuracy of your listings, the more likely they will reward you with repeat business.</p>
<h2>Product Data Feed Management tools for better listings</h2>
<p>Listing your products across a variety of digital channels is a way of ensuring you’ve left no stone unturned.</p>
<p>While<a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/us-ecommerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Amazon accounts for an estimated 40% of eCommerce activity</a>, for example, that leaves a significant percentage of other channels and <a href="https://Suvae.org/online-marketplaces-usa-expand-ecommerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketplaces where opportunities abound</a>. This is especially true for luxury brands that want to take an international approach to market to the most discerning, high-net-worth consumers.</p>
<p>Besides marketplaces, connecting to your total addressable market could mean <a href="https://Suvae.org/reach-customers-social-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pursuing social commerce</a> on channels such as Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok. Review sites and price comparison sites are other important touchpoints to consider.</p>
<h2>Why choose Suvae.org as your Data Feed Solution Provider</h2>
<p>Creating the perfect ads to match users’ intent and deliver the right information becomes faster and easier with the right solutions in place.</p>
<p>First, <strong>automation</strong> takes away manual efforts that are both time-consuming and prone to human error.</p>
<p>Secondly, <strong>synchronizing your listings with multiple channels at once</strong> allows you and your team to focus on analyzing the performance of your marketing campaigns to drive better results.</p>
<p><strong>Hightstreet.io’s feed management platform</strong> was designed with these needs in mind. That’s why we offer <b>effective and efficient backend synchronizations with the most popular eCommerce platforms.</b> This includes Salesforce Commerce Cloud, IBM WCX, Magento, Shopify, and Oracle.</p>
<p>Once you’ve gotten set up, you’ll discover how to manage disparate data objects such as product data, inventory data, prices, orders, stores, and promotions.<br />
This kind of granularity will bring greater precision to your efforts to connect your customers to the right information.</p>
<p>By linking your feeds with Google Analytics’ key performance indicators, meanwhile, Highsteet.io <b>enriches feeds based on product performance</b>. These feeds are based on real-time data, using application programming interfaces (APIs) in both data sources and output feeds.</p>
<p><strong>The true power of the Suvae.org product data feed management</strong> platform also comes through <b>optimizations based on artificial intelligence</b> (AI), with automated keyword extractions and category mappings. You can block the delivery of a feed based on certain conditions and receive customized alerts as part of your monitoring extensions.</p>
<p>Of course, getting started with product feeds successfully depends on having a partner who’s ready to work with you. <strong>Suvae.org simplifies business process management</strong> (BPM) support to handle a variety of feed sequences and conditional behavior and leverage scripting techniques to assist with any use cases.</p>
<p><a href="https://Suvae.org/contact-us/"><b>Reach out to us to schedule a call with our team</b></a> and find out how easy it can be to promote your products successfully.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As leisure travel skyrockets, consumers are increasing their spending on the world’s top eCommerce search engine from previous years. It&#8217;s almost like the back-to-school season, but instead of buying pens and binders, your customers are looking for clothing, books, and anything and everything that will ensure their perfect holiday.</p>
<p>Looking at summer sales on Amazon, eMarketer expects <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/what-expect-during-amazon-s-prime-day-sale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon’s Prime Day sales event will generate $12.52 billion in worldwide revenues</a> this year, a year-over-year (YoY) gain of 17.0%, per their new forecast.</p>
<p>So how do you get your Amazon Product listings optimized so they’ll be found by vacationers with money to spend?</p>
<p>It starts with understanding what Amazon product listings are and how consumers use the platform to find what they’re looking for. It may sound straightforward, but as you’ll learn in this post, there are many factors to succeed on the world’s top eCommerce search engine.</p>
<h2>What are Amazon Product Listings</h2>
<p>Before online shopping, customers that knew exactly what product they were looking for could call the store and put it on hold or go into the store and describe the product by referencing the brand, color, name, material, and any other unique features.</p>
<p>On Amazon, your listing contains all the information on your product page. Amazon does the searching, and the products displayed heavily rely on the data you’ve included with your Amazon product listings.</p>
<p>Basic product listing details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product ID</li>
<li>Model Number</li>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Color</li>
<li>Brand</li>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Image</li>
<li>Shipping Details</li>
</ul>
<p>You provide this information either with a feed or an API specific to Amazon’s requirements.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that not all listings are the same. There could be three resellers listing the same product on Amazon, and their product information could be slightly different.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12609" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Amazon-Product-Listing-Example.jpg" alt="Amazon Product Listing Example" width="750" height="347" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Amazon-Product-Listing-Example.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Amazon-Product-Listing-Example-480x222.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>To get more details on how to list your products, check out Amazon’s <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/202073140?language=en-US&amp;ref=mpbc_200463270_cont_202073140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Listing Guidelines</a>.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Selling on Amazon</h2>
<p>Picture the world’s biggest, most busy shopping center with an endless variety of products: this is what Amazon would be like as a physical marketplace. It’s the largest eCommerce retailer by online revenue in the world. The <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1218313/amazon-revenue-development-ecommercedb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net sales from Amazon.com alone skyrocketed in 2022 to 162,360 million US dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can benefit from selling your products on Amazon:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The ability to use Amazon FBA </b>(Fulfillment by Amazon) to store and ship your products for a low price allowing your customers the ability to use their Prime membership to get deals on free or inexpensive shipping and short shipping times.</li>
<li><b>Expand internationally</b> for a lower cost and less labor than setting up global distribution on your own.</li>
<li><b>Be where your customers are.</b> If your customers are on Amazon, it makes sense to list your products where they shop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep reading to find out how your customers use the platform and search around the platform to find products like yours.</p>
<h2>How Customers Find Your Product Listing</h2>
<p>Like browsing in a physical store, the same shopper that was frantically looking for a phone case yesterday could be back today with more time to browse different brands and promotions.</p>
<p>Picturing your customer&#8217;s shopping scenarios isn’t the hard part. To get maximum product exposure, you must understand how Amazon’s platform delivers your product listings.</p>
<h3>What to know about Amazon Categories</h3>
<p>Imagine a perfectly merchandised brick-and-mortar shop where shoppers can find what they’re looking for at a quick glance.<br />
In her ideal shopping experience, a female customer looking for running shoes walks into the shoe section and immediately sees the Women’s section, an Athletic subsection, and Road Running within that section. Within minutes the shopper can make sense of the categories to find what she’s looking for. .</p>
<p><a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G200332540?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Categories on Amazon</a> work the same way. There are multiple ways to categorize your products, and the more you think like a shopper browsing in a store section, the better chance you have of being found.</p>
<p>You also need to consider the ultimate goal of earning the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GGGMZK378RQPATDJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Best Seller badge</a> to help boost your sales. For example, carefully selecting a niche category like “Road Running” in the Women’s shoe section will have less competition than “Women’s shoes,” resulting in a better chance to rank higher in sales.</p>
<p>Choosing the right category is a good first step to getting in front of more customers, but there are more factors to consider if you want to achieve the #1 best-seller spot.</p>
<h3>Getting your products on the Best Seller Page</h3>
<p>Best Seller products on Amazon are like the most popular items at the front of your store that are flying off the shelves. If you don’t buy them now, they may not be in stock when you return. You can find these items on their<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers/zgbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Best Seller page</a> and see them marked with the coveted “Best Seller” orange label.</p>
<p>Apple’s AirTag Cases are listed as an Amazon Best Seller this summer. They became popular when leisure travel peaked, and travelers dealt with busy airports and the potential for lost luggage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12610" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Apple-Air-Tag-Holder-Best-Seller-Amazon.jpg" alt="Apple Air Tag Holder Best Seller Amazon" width="750" height="173" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Apple-Air-Tag-Holder-Best-Seller-Amazon.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Apple-Air-Tag-Holder-Best-Seller-Amazon-480x110.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The orange badge can be challenging for you to attain but not impossible. You can achieve this status if you get the highest sales numbers in a specific category, which is calculated and updated hourly by sales history and velocity.</p>
<p>To help you build your sales and reach this level, you can leverage a few tactics to attract more customers to your listings. One of these methods is keyword optimization.</p>
<h3>How to be found using Amazon Keywords</h3>
<p>Similar to Google, the more specific information a shopper includes in their search, the better the chance they’ll find what they’re looking for.</p>
<p>For instance, if a travel shopper uses the keyword “sunscreen” but is looking for a “LaRoche Posay tinted moisturizer with sunscreen,” they’ll get two different sets of results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12612" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LaRoche-Posay-Tinted-Moisturizer-Amazon-Product-Listing.jpg" alt="LaRoche Posay Tinted Moisturizer Amazon Product Listing" width="751" height="475" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LaRoche-Posay-Tinted-Moisturizer-Amazon-Product-Listing.jpg 751w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LaRoche-Posay-Tinted-Moisturizer-Amazon-Product-Listing-480x304.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 751px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is where good Amazon keyword research helps shoppers find your products. There are two types of keywords to use in your product listings:</p>
<ol>
<li>primary keywords</li>
<li>hidden keywords (title &amp; description)</li>
</ol>
<p>Read more detail on how to <a href="https://Suvae.org/sell-using-amazon-product-listing-keywords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Sell More Using Amazon Product Listing Keywords</a></p>
<p>Choosing the right keywords is important but optimizing all of the data using Amazon product listing integration will give your products the best chance of being discovered.</p>
<h2>Tips for Amazon Product Listing Integration using Product Feeds</h2>
<p>Strolling through a department store, you’ll notice that the same item could be in multiple locations based on factors like brand, color, category, promotion, or popularity. Amazon uses your product data to decide where to place your items on its website. To connect your data, you need some technical expertise in marketplace integration.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for integrating your products and creating a product feed for Amazon:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <a href="https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Selling Partner API</a> to structure your product data to increase your product’s rankings and listings. This API includes a list of your stock and each item’s attributes.</li>
<li>Use Amazon’s <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/202073140?language=en-US&amp;ref=mpbc_200463270_cont_202073140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Listing Guidelines</a> and <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200390640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Detail Page Rules</a> to ensure you follow the right requirements to be approved</li>
<li>Download a <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G201576430?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product inventory file template</a> from Amazon to add your product data to create a data feed</li>
<li>To sell globally, register through <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Seller Central</a>. If Amazon is managing your product inventory, then your Amazon data feed requires a fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) flag</li>
</ol>
<h2>How an Amazon Product Listing Service can help</h2>
<p>The difference between hiring a qualified Amazon Product Listing Optimization, and Marketplace Integration Service is like hiring a reputable tour company that takes care of all of your travel details compared to booking everything yourself.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, eCommerce purchases have increased significantly in Italy. Data from The eCommerce B2C Osservatorio of the School of Management Politecnico di Milano report shows a significant growth in online purchases by Italians in 2020: EUR 4.7 billion, or 26 percent more than in 2019. This growth has resulted in booming eCommerce performance for many companies while pushing retailers who until now have been &#8220;sitting on the fence&#8221; to accelerate their development plans for an omnichannel presence. This means not only starting to sell online — with all the complexities that this entails — but managing all marketing &amp; marketplace channels in an integrated manner. This also includes physical points of sale which, more than ever, must be supported with tools to broaden the reach and increase the flow of visitors.</p>
<p><strong>Below is an interview with the founder of Kipcast, Giovanni Guardalben.</strong></p>
<h3>The customer is the core of omnichannel paths</h3>
<p>Local inventory and eCommerce performance strategies are the core of <a href="https://kipcast.com">Kipcast</a>&#8216;s offering. The Italian-Canadian company was founded in 2006 with the aim of aggregating and distributing optimized web content to analysts, publishers, and product directories. Over time, data has been replaced by content. Today, Kipcast&#8217;s technology helps companies sell online using product-based marketing strategies and for physical retailers to promote local inventory online marketing approaches. These approaches, are the key to engaging consumers, attracting them to local stores, and retaining their loyalty.</p>
<h3>Campaign management, a boost for sales</h3>
<p>Kipcast provides retailers and brands with tools to improve the performance of their marketing campaigns and sales in three ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, with our feed management tool, which allows companies to market their products effectively using options like Facebook Dynamic Product Ads, Google Shopping, Online Comparison Sites, Affiliate Websites, and Retargeting and Remarketing Engines,” explained Giovanni Guardalben, Kipcast’s founder. “Secondly, through the integrated management of orders on third-party online stores and marketplaces, taking care of all integration activities for order processing, logistics, and fulfillment. Finally, by offering consultancy and technical support in the creation of marketing campaigns designed for effective local inventory-based campaigns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kipcast offers two platforms: <br /><a href="https://Suvae.org/product-feed-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suvae.org</a> is a feed management solution used by over 200 retail, fashion, and consumer electronics brands, including Luisaviaroma, Timberland, Prada, Vans, and Unieuro. Clicktobrick.io, on the other hand, is a tool for managing local marketing campaigns on Google Ads, aimed at increasing the number of visitors to stores. Both are cloud-based and usable with a Software as a Service pricing model. The two Kipcast platforms are architecturally similar but designed to perform different tasks and benefit from the company’s expertise in data integration.</p>
<h3>eCommerce KPIs, the role of data integration</h3>
<p>Integrating an eCommerce platform with advertising platforms and marketplaces requires technical skills that are often lacking in marketing agencies or marketing departments. The biggest obstacles are data collection, data homogenization, and the synchronization of data.</p>
<p>This is where <a href="https://Suvae.org">Suvae.org</a> comes in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our platform connects to our client’s backend to manage product feeds on one side and the order cycle, logistics, and fulfillment on the other. Suvae.org simplifies the import of a product catalog by cleaning up the feeds, structuring them, and standardizing the feeds in different formats — API, XML, CSV, and JSON. As a result, Suvae.org’s platform and support are essential for marketers dealing with increasingly complex data integration, which jeopardizes their eCommerce performance and campaign management.&#8221; explained Guardalben.</p>
<p>Data can be acquired directly from Suvae.org by using APIs and the native connectivity of the platform with the customer&#8217;s eCommerce system. It can also be acquired through a master catalog or through the real-time acquisition of notifications of changes in the offer, which the customer communicates directly to Kipcast. The data is distributed by Suvae.org to various marketing channels and marketplaces through appropriate format transformations and then updated in real-time, as needed.</p>
<p>The system is designed for the rapid onboarding of new customers, thanks to the increasingly intensive use of artificial intelligence algorithms. &#8220;Our Feed Complete approach includes a series of technologies that allow for the generation of rich digital content even in the absence of structured data,” noted Giovanni Guardalben. “This leads to significant time savings when publishing catalogs on different channels. We take care of everything; acquiring and unifying data from the eCommerce site and the company&#8217;s backend. We then integrate the client&#8217;s backend into our platform using a direct connection, which requires no additional development effort. The retailer is then able to manage Amazon orders directly with SAP or other major ERPs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kipcast&#8217;s services also extend to Automated Product Fulfillment Management. This includes order capture from the marketplace and transfers to the customer, the capture of order fulfillment status and shipping information from the customer, and the transfer of this information to the online merchant.</p>
<h3>One-click product listing campaigns</h3>
<p>Companies operating on marketplaces must know how to make the most of product data. Usually, those who start selling online start with an AdWords campaign, which is supported by a campaign budget aimed at appearing at the top of Google search results. These placements are ads with paid product cards that show a photo of the reference, a brief description of its main features, an indication of the price, and the name of the store. These ads are known as Product Listing Ads (PLA).</p>
<p>PLAs are essential in capturing the attention of someone conducting an online search for that product category and can, therefore, be considered a &#8220;quality&#8221; click, which offers a good chance to convert.</p>
<p>&#8220;To create effective PLAs, we develop data sets that are impeccable from an SEO point of view, with quality data that is always up to date, and with highly engaging and optimized content. It&#8217;s a particularly complex job that requires technical skills in data integration, content management, and SEO writing that virtually no company or agency has in-house,” says Guardalben. “Further complicating matters are PLA technical specifications and formats that change frequently. The risk, for those who don&#8217;t adapt quickly, is to see the efforts and investments committed to the online channel wasted. This is why we have begun to offer our consultation in this area, in particular for Google Shopping.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Suvae.org platform is designed to optimize product data (attributes and variants) so that the offer is highlighted, ensuring the best sales performance. In addition, the use of different templates allows for the rapid modification of feeds, which must be changed often to take into account not only the changes in the availability of products in stock but also new promotions, maximizing the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns.</p>
<h3>Click to Brick to facilitate retail rebound</h3>
<p>Post-pandemic retail rebound, however, also involves rethinking the role of physical stores. An effective omnichannel strategy not only enhances online sales but also creates new experiences and shopping opportunities in physical stores by supporting them with promotions and localized online campaigns.</p>
<p>Kipcast’s Clicktobrick.io campaign management platform optimizes text search and displays campaigns in a Google Ads environment. This solution allows you to improve the effectiveness of the local inventory campaigns, which, in turn, increases visits to physical stores.</p>
<p>The efficient synchronization of local product data guarantees that only the products that are available in that store are advertised, with messages visible only to the people who are located around the store. &#8220;Kipcast is the Italian partner of reference for the development of Google Local Inventory Ads campaigns, the new way of making campaigns integrated with Google My Business, which aims to generate traffic to the point of sale,” concluded Giovanni Guardalben. “The most evident result is the increase in conversions, accompanied by a reduction in operating costs linked to the more effective management of local stock.&#8221; This is a very pressing issue in this re-opening phase [during the pandemic].</p>

<p><span id="more-1166"></span></p>
<h2 id="whatis">What is a product data feed?</h2>
<p>A product data feed is a file that includes a text-based list of data and attributes from an eCommerce store. The file includes product details that are uniquely displayed, advertised or compared online.</p>
<p>Fields typically included in a product data feed are product title, description, price, size, image and product identifier. More complex feeds can include language, currency, marketing copy, <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/3455481?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google custom labels</a>, search engine marketing (SEM) content, social recommendations, product ratings and best seller information. The destination of your feed determines what type of data to include.</p>
<h2 id="wheredoyousend">Where do you send a product data feed?</h2>
<p>There is a large variety of <a href="https://Suvae.org/shopping-channel-partners/">online shopping distribution channels</a> that use product data feeds. Although it may appear easy to take an existing eCommerce catalog and create a product data feed, the specifications of most online distribution channels differ. Configure each product data feed in a unique way to meet the channel’s standards.</p>
<p>Here are some popular online channels that retailers use to market and sell inventory.</p>

<h2 id="howconnected">How does a product data feed connect to a marketing channel?</h2>
<p>The configuration of product data feeds must meet submission requirements from each online distribution channel to get the best results from their platform.</p>
<p><strong>Submit Product Catalog data via:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Standard download over the URL</li>
<li>Standard upload over the URL</li>
<li>APIs. (Open APIs or Google Content APIs)</li>
<li>FTP /SFTP uploads</li>
<li>FTP/SFTP downloads</li>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2>What are the 4 most popular techniques to generate a product feed for a shopping channel?</h2>
<p>There are many ways to generate a product feed. Before choosing a method, consider the size and scope of your eCommerce catalog and the potential shopping channels you want to list your products on.</p>
<p>These four techniques are the most popular ways to generate a feed for retailers to market and distribute their products online.</p>
<h4><strong>1. Manual Uploads/Downloads</strong></h4>
<p><strong>For new or smaller eCommerce businesses</strong>, you can start by manually uploading or downloading catalog product data to a channel in a standard file format (spreadsheet, CSV, TSV).</p>
<p>If you have product information, inventory updates or the shopping channel changes their feed requirements, new files need to be manually uploaded or downloaded.</p>
<p>At times, channels like <a href="https://www.google.com/retail/merchant-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Merchant Center</a>, <a href="http://www.ebay.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eBay</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon,</a> and others have been known to update their feed standards, thus requiring an updated product data feed.</p>
<p>Retailers usually handle this process internally until their catalog or online distribution channels increase to the point where they need an automated feed.</p>
<p><strong>Works best for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New eCommerce businesses</li>
<li>Retailers with small product catalogs that require minimal ongoing changes</li>
<li>Product data in one language targeted to one country and sent to one online distribution channel (such as Google Merchant Center)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fairly simple and can be modified quickly by a non-technical person</li>
<li>Most online distribution channels accept this file format</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can require significant time and attention to manually manage the correct product data unique to each online distribution channel</li>
<li>Can require dedicated resources with experience in two-plus channels</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>2. Programmatic Feed Generation</strong></h4>
<p>For <strong>more established and/or larger eCommerce businesses</strong>, Programmatic feeds can be generated using a procedure that dynamically creates a product data feed based on a set of variables. These variables prompt the feed to pull specific product information updates from a retailer&#8217;s eCommerce system, therefore providing shopping channels with the most updated and tailored information. Once the feeds are created, they can be made available for download or upload from within an eCommerce processor (such as <a href="http://www.magento.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magento</a> and <a href="http://www.shopify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a>).</p>
<p>To develop a programmatic feed, retailers can use either their in-house tech team, an outside software integrator, or a <a href="https://Suvae.org/product-feed-management/">product feed management provider</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Works best for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Retailers with the knowledge, expertise, and resources to support managing feeds internally OR companies who&#8217;d rather free up IT and <strong>rely on an experienced product feed management company.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This technique is the most widely adopted <strong>product feed creation technique for eCommerce websites</strong></li>
<li>Almost every feed format is supported by this method (such as XML and JSON)</li>
<li>Feeds dynamically adjust to the business rules of the eCommerce site instead of manually updating the feed every time there is a change (such as price changes and special offers)</li>
<li>Product data can be sent using standard protocols (such as FTP, SFTP, HTTP(S), and POST) which meet the feed submission requirements for channels like <a href="https://www.google.com/shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google,</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/a/online-sales/dynamic-product-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, and <a href="http://www.adroll.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdRoll</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When adding new product marketing campaigns to an eCommerce platform, new queries are required to access the updated product data. Developing these queries is less labor intensive than manually updating the information but it is important to have an experienced product data feed team that can design and execute the queries.</li>
<li>If there are ongoing changes in pricing and other product information, multiple queries need to be developed to access the new product data. This process can make the feed update process slow and <a href="http://techterms.com/definition/cpu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPU (Central Processing Unit)</a> intensive. Creating a daily product feed that only queries updates, instead of updating multiple feeds constantly, is a practical solution to updating large amounts of data.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>3. Extended eCommerce Platform Feed Generation</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Small to Medium-sized eCommerce businesses</strong> with larger catalogs may choose to use an API/plugin method instead of a feed. Depending on which eCommerce platform the products reside in, the platform can be extended by using a third-party extension, also known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plug-in</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Catalog product data can be transformed into feeds and sent to digital marketing partners</strong> and marketplaces using the plug-in connected to your eCommerce platform (such as <a href="http://www.magento.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magento,</a> or <a href="http://www.shopify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a>). In most cases, plug-ins include limited personalization and configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Works best for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Small to medium-sized retailers with frequent product and inventory updates</li>
<li>Feeds configured for two or more online distribution channels</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Plug-ins are fairly easy to configure by an eCommerce Information Technology person</li>
<li>The implementation should not involve a large team</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Customization can be challenging if you want to change the plug-in’s specifications</li>
<li>Every time a marketing channel updates its standards it is up to the software creator to update the plug-in’s code. This update may take a long time or might not happen at all depending on how diligent the third-party plug-in creator is at providing timely updates</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>4. Remote access to an eCommerce Platform or PIM Platform (Product Information Management) </strong></h4>
<p>In this case, a SaaS Product Feed Management supplier connects to their client’s eCommerce platform or PIM and remotely <strong>synchronizes product data to online distribution channels</strong>. Raw data from the eCommerce platform can be seamlessly transformed into feeds and matched to each channel&#8217;s specifications.</p>
<p><strong>Works best for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Companies with <a href="http://www.macys.com">large catalogs</a> using product data feeds to distribute inventory to many online distribution channels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The<strong> SaaS system processes and distributes product data feeds</strong> rather than the client’s eCommerce system. This process saves time and CPU cycles on the client-side</li>
<li>By using templates and scripting the feed has the<strong> flexibility to be custom configured</strong> for the needs of online distribution channels like Google Merchant Center</li>
<li>This method allows an eCommerce company to tie in their product updates in their eCommerce system to product updates in their product marketing feeds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A robust eCommerce platform or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_information_management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Information Management</a> (PIM) platform or the ability for the SaaS platform to store some product data is needed to house marketing campaign data along with product data</li>
<li>Remote protocols unless supported by SMART APIs can take more time to display product data unless you have a way to batch the data. To be efficient, either upload massive amounts of feed data all at once, use a SMART API to upload batches of data, or only upload updates to the feed</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Advertising products online seem straightforward. Simple enough at first, until you want to achieve more with your shopping campaigns.</p>
<p>In this post, you&#8217;ll discover the key factors to determine when you need to take the next step to a <strong>full-service data management platform. </strong>But first, let&#8217;s review what a Data Management Platform is and how it can benefit you and your business.</p>
<h2 class="entry-title">What is a Product Data Management Platform?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Feed Management Platform is a software platform used to collect and manage all your product data. This system allows you to have highly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">optimized information about your products, centralizing all those details into one file(product feed) to better promote your products across multiple channels, in different markets, and reach targeted audiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Full-Service Data Feed Management Platform helps you with all your </span><b>data management</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needs, from data feed creation, configuration, optimization, and synchronization, to customization.<br />
</span>Let&#8217;s dive into some of the reasons why and when you should consider a Full-Service Product Data Management Platform</p>
<h2>Promote Products in other Countries, Currencies &amp; Languages</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to advertise your products in other countries, languages, and currencies there are a few challenges you might be facing.</p>
<p>To customize campaigns for different markets, you want to create dedicated feeds for each specific channel and customize your campaigns for each market you are going to sell on.<br />
Here are some examples of <strong>scenarios that require separate feeds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to tie a promotion to a certain country and not have that promotion show up in your other feeds.</li>
<li>If you want to use dedicated promotions in certain countries and you don&#8217;t want the promotions showing up in other markets.</li>
<li>When your product data from the master source contains some data that is only in one language and you want to remove it for other countries.</li>
<li>Your inventory might change for different countries depending on where the merchandise is being stored.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you start advertising in more than one country and you’re creating multiple feeds for each channel in each country you need to be able to manage a large volume of feeds. This might not be that easy.</p>
<p>Here is where a <strong>full-service data management feed platform can help</strong>. The platform and service allow you to <strong>manage all your feeds, making sure they are all updated correctly as well as optimized for each country and channel.</strong></p>
<h3>Increase the Number of Products To Sell</h3>
<p>As your business grows so can your product inventory. If you find you have ongoing technical feed issues because of the volume of your products then it is time to look at a full-service data feed management platform.<br />
Some of the<strong> typical challenges brands and retailers have when they increase their product inventory</strong> can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product variants are mixed up when the data is pulled from the eCommerce platform. They need to be adjusted and reordered to match Google&#8217;s requirements.</li>
<li>The more products you sell the more likely your products will sell out. If your inventory displaying in your ads isn’t up-to-date because it’s taking too long to synchronize with the website then the channel you’re advertising on might stop showing your ads.</li>
<li>If you’re selling high volumes of products on your site the need for real-time synchronization of your products might be needed. You always want your website inventory to match the inventory displayed on other channels that promote your products.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re having these challenges then it might be<strong> time to start working with a product data feed management company</strong>. Keep reading to learn more.</p>
<h3>Increase the Number of Distribution Channels</h3>
<p>The more channels you advertise on the more technical issues you’ll have. Seriously, do you have that much time to dedicate to feed issues?</p>
<p>Nearly every distribution channel you use to promote your products has different feed specifications. This means the product data within each feed should be customized to the needs of that channel and follow channel requirements. If you’re promoting your products in 5 different channels that means 5 feeds times the number of countries you’re advertising in.</p>
<p>Some popular distribution channels include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comparison Shopping Websites &amp; Search Engine Marketing:</strong> Google Shopping, Bing Shopping, Nextag, Shopzilla &amp; PriceGrabber</li>
<li><strong>Social Commerce:</strong> <a href="https://Suvae.org/facebook-dynamic-product-ads/">Facebook Dynamic Product Ads</a>, Instagram Shoppable Posts</li>
<li><strong>Affiliate Networks:</strong> Rakuten/Linkshare, CJ, <a href="https://Suvae.org/join-awin-affiliate-program/">Awin</a></li>
<li><strong>Retargeting Networks:</strong> Criteo &amp; AdRoll</li>
<li><strong>On-Site Services/Tools:</strong> Site Search, Recommendation Engines &amp; Size Finders</li>
</ul>
