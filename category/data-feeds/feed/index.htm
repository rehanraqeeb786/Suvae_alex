										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know a great product title when you see one. It’s that perfect combination of keywords that somehow makes it irresistible to click through and add the product to your shopping cart.</p>
<p>Creating product titles at that level can seem like a mysterious process, or a specialized skill. As generative AI in eCommerce becomes more pervasive, however, it’s possible for any brand to <a href="https://highstreet.io/product-title-optimization-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create product titles that attract online shoppers and convert them</a> into loyal buyers.</p>
<h2>The role of generative AI in B2B ecommerce optimization</h2>
<p>Product title optimization is just one example of how generative AI in eCommerce is transforming the way brands operate. For several years now, companies have been training specialized algorithms on datasets known as large language models (LLMs) that allow software solutions to not only analyze information but produce new content.</p>
<p>Some generative AI in eCommerce tools have been focused on easily creating images for marketing campaigns, or copy for social media. However product title optimization may be the most promising area given the potential for AI to ease the process of developing effective titles quickly and at scale.</p>
<h2>Introducing Highstreet.io’s approach to generative AI in eCommerce</h2>
<p>Highstreet.io, for example, is now offering <b>AI data enrichment and data classification </b>and the ability to leverage third-party AI writing for e-commerce tools. This means brands can create multiple variations of copy to test and refine their product title optimization strategy, choosing only those titles and descriptions that prove engaging, relevant and have a propensity for high click-through rates (CTR).</p>
<p>These product titles can be enriched by a Highstreet.io AI component that can handle specific requests, like making a title grammatically correct without changing the word order.</p>
<p>Highstreet.io’s product feed management solution, meanwhile, uses an AI algorithm that takes context that’s already known about a product (such as how it has been mapped to existing fields, for example) and scores it for enhanced classification. There’s even a fallback classification the AI algorithm can use if no existing product context is available.</p>
<h2>Generative AI in ecommerce for SEO optimized product title and descriptions</h2>
<p>When you’re developing an eCommerce product description, AI can get you from a blank screen to a finished draft in seconds. Using AI for product title optimization is arguably even more powerful, because if the title is good enough, consumers might not even read the description and simply buy the product directly.</p>
<p>Effective product title optimization involves mastering a few basic elements. This includes developing titles in such a way that online shoppers will instantly recognize the product’s main features, whether or not they go on to read the full description.</p>
<p><a href="https://highstreet.io/google-shopping-optimization-product-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A good product title</a> will also come across as written for human beings, rather than stuffed with keywords so as to appeal to a search engine’s algorithm. That said, titles should include a primary and secondary keyword to ensure a listing is easy to find online. Finally, great product titles convey the benefit or reason to buy the product, giving customers greater confidence in their purchasing decision.</p>
<h2>5 of the best AI writing for eCommerce tools</h2>
<p>Highstreet.io works with all the most well-known AI writing for eCommerce tools, including:</p>
<h3>ChatGPT</h3>
<p>Developed by Open AI,<a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ChatGPT</a> may be the best known generative AI solution and ignited huge interest in the category. It takes a conversational approach whereby users can simply type in a simple prompt such as “write a product title for XYZ brand based on its latest designer blouse” and get a result almost instantly.</p>
<p>ChatGPT’s base product is free but a $20/month ChatGPT Plus professional subscription offering promises faster response times and early access to new features.</p>
<h3>Writesonic</h3>
<p>Aimed largely at professional business users,<a href="https://d.docs.live.net/a13092c8c4cee8c7/Documents/Writesonic%20com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Writesonic</a> promises to help develop content that aligns with a brand’s particular tone of voice and writing style. It can not only be used to generate product titles but longer form content such as blog posts and articles of more than 1,500 words.</p>
<p>Writesonic has several pricing options, starting with a free version to a $79/month plan for solo marketers and small teams all the way to a $99.999 per year enterprise version.</p>
<h3>Copy.ai</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.copy.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copy.ai</a> offers similar features as other tools that help with  generative AI in eCommerce, but stands out for a well-stocked library of templates for writing headlines and one-paragraph descriptions. It also includes workflows to help streamline common tasks in sales and marketing such as lead targeting.</p>
<p>Beyond a free version, Copy.ai’s one-seat starter subscription costs $36/month, while an advanced version with five seats is priced at $186 a month.</p>
<h3>Jarvis</h3>
<p>Powered by GPT4.5,<a href="https://d.docs.live.net/a13092c8c4cee8c7/Documents/jarvis.cx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Jarvis</a> bills itself as an all-in-one AI assistant. That means besides AI writing for eCommerce, Jarvis can summarize content, translate it and explore content via a chat function.</p>
<p>Jarvis also has a free version and it offers a one-month trial of the more advanced Starter version that has more chat models, which then costs $9.99/month. The Pro version offers unlimited queries per year and also has a one-month free trail before costing $79/month.</p>
<h3>Anyword</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.anyword.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anyword</a> has positioned itself as an AI tool for writing social media copy and ads, which could include creating well-optimized product titles for a brand’s website or marketplace listing. It also offers tools to detect whether content is similar to what’s already online and a number of third-party integrations.</p>
<p>Anyword has three plans: a $49.99/month Starter, a $99/month “Data Driven” version that backs up content with its performance data and a $499.99/month Business version where its algorithm is trained on its most successful past campaigns. Enterprise pricing is available upon request.</p>
<h2>Future trends in generative AI for B2B ecommerce</h2>
<p>Generative AI in eCommerce is only going to become more advanced as companies develop better natural language processing engines and further integrate with existing digital marketing and sales tools.</p>
<p>Today, many people are using AI writing for eCommerce software to revise their first attempts at <b>product title optimization</b>. Over time, the technology may offer the perfect copy on the first try, whether you’re using an eCommerce product description AI writing tool or something similar.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Highstreet.io’s AI capabilities will help brands do an even better job of setting up product feeds with less effort while driving greater performance and revenue. Whether you’re focused on creating product titles, exploring data enrichment or improving the way products are classified, the time to begin leveraging generative AI in eCommerce is now.</p>

<p>Product title optimization is a surprisingly powerful way to address many of these issues. It helps you ensure customers find the items they want, that they’ll have all the details they need and that your content is ready to be distributed through any digital channel. .</p>
<h2>What is Product Title Optimization?</h2>
<p>Hopefully, your brand is already actively practicing search engine optimization (SEO) for the various sections of your website. This usually involves researching relevant keywords that reflect what your target market tends to look for on platforms like Google.</p>
<p>Product title optimization is part of SEO, but one that’s easily overlooked. It’s a process of making changes in how items are described to improve their performance. By <b>optimizing product titles</b>, you’re ensuring that what you’re publishing online relates to common search queries.</p>
<p>This helps your brand on several levels. From a marketing perspective, learning about Google Shopping product title optimization will drive more organic traffic back to your eCommerce pages. If you’re selling on marketplaces, perfecting Amazon product title optimization, for example, will give you the best chance of being discovered by a large audience of shoppers.</p>
<p>A well-optimized product title also makes intuitive sense. If your customers were visiting a physical store, you’d want to make signage clear and provide enough information to lead them directly to the products they want. The same principle holds true online.</p>
<h2>Product Title Optimization: Examples</h2>
<p>The most valuable customers – the ones who spend more, and spend more often – are always looking for something specific and special.</p>
<p>If they search on Google for “luxury handbags,” for instance, generic results won’t interest them.</p>
<p>Optimizing product titles should take into account the materials you use, the uniqueness of a style, and anything else that might make a search result or ad stand out. Consider the following:</p>
<p><b>(Brand name) Trendsetter Saffino Leather Compact Yellow Handbag</b></p>
<p>In just a few words, this fictitious brand has not only included its product’s name (Trendsetter), but details that speak to its quality, size, and color.</p>
<p>The same goes for other kinds of products. If you’re selling footwear, there’s a big difference between “men’s dress shoe” and “Men’s Italian leather upper tasseled loafer.” In this case, little things can make a big difference – not only in terms of how content is displayed on the web but in product feeds that support all your digital channels.</p>
<h2>How does Product Title Optimization work?</h2>
<p>There’s a lot to consider when you’re optimizing product titles. Make sure you address all of the following:</p>
<h3>1. Study the requirements of any search engines, digital channels, or online marketplaces</h3>
<p>Most brands don’t rely solely on their own websites to generate the online shopping activity they need to grow. If you’re taking advantage of popular search engines or marketplaces, do your homework by checking what they expect to see.</p>
<p><a href="https://highstreet.io/google-shopping-optimization-product-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Shopping product title optimization</a>, for instance, has specific syntax, schema, and structure to make the most of its services. Look for any information that is provided to sellers, like this SEO guide that includes<a href="https://sell.amazon.com/blog/amazon-seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> steps for Amazon product title optimization</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Use keyword research to ensure relevant search queries</h3>
<p>Digital shoppers may be searching online without realizing you carry exactly what they want or need. The only way to ensure you align is by using keyword search tools and imagining yourself in their place to identify the kind of phrases they’re likely to key into Google.</p>
<p>In general, the right use of keywords will communicate what your product is, what it does, and what kind of problem it solves – even if the “problem” is adding the perfect garment or accessory to their wardrobe.</p>
<h3>3. Balance being descriptive with keeping titles short</h3>
<p>There’s an art in conveying the value your product is providing without asking consumers (or Google) to parse a significant amount of text.</p>
<p>Aim for seven words or less, or about 50 to 75 characters. As you’re optimizing product titles, ask yourself if there is anything redundant, unnecessary, or overly verbose. Bear in mind that shoppers will be seeing your products among many others. Respect their time and give them a great experience by making it easy to scan.</p>
<h3>4. Weave product variations (size, colors, etc.) into titles</h3>
<p>Customers love choice, which is one of the reasons many brands have learned to offer their products in a variety of styles, colors, sizes, textures, and more.</p>
<p>Product title optimization should take into account these variants, including those where there are none. “One size” might be included in a title for an item that is one-size-fits-all, for instance.</p>
<h3>5. Structure titles by prioritizing the most critical information first</h3>
<p>Some of your target market is probably still shopping online using their desktop PC, but many others will have opted for a mobile device like their smartphone. That means there is the chance a portion of your title could get off when it’s displayed in search results or shopping ads.</p>
<p>To mitigate this, think carefully about structure when you’re optimizing product titles. You can begin with your product’s brand name, for instance, followed by the material, color, and size. Depending on what’s most important to your customers, however, it might be better for the brand name to be followed by the color first, then size and material. Outside of fashion categories, specific product features might need to come before other descriptors.</p>
<h3>6. Optimize titles with product descriptions in mind</h3>
<p>While product title optimization is important, it’s not your only chance to sell consumers on the value an item is providing.</p>
<p>When they click through an ad or search result, for instance, you’ll have the opportunity to provide a more detailed product description on your website or an online marketplace. Don’t simply repeat the same information in these areas. Think of the product title as the cover of a book and the description as the story they came to hear.</p>
<h3>7. Review competitor brands and revise accordingly</h3>
<p>Back when telephone print directories were the easiest place to search for a business, a housepainting company might have called itself AA Painters so it would be listed first. A competitor might try to get ahead by calling itself AAA Painters. You have to be more sophisticated when you’re using search engines, but it still pays to keep an eye on what rival companies are doing.</p>
<p>Are your competitors using the same product title structure for most of their items? It might mean shoppers gravitate to that format, but it could also be a chance to innovate by highlighting a different detail first. Do they use the same adjectives that you use? Maybe you can find a synonym to set yourself apart. Always be looking for attributes in product titles that will convey your uniqueness as a brand.</p>
<h3>8. Act like a “Mystery Shopper” and think through the customer journey online</h3>
<p>Now and then pretend you’re not an employee at your brand but the kind of person it is hoping to cultivate as a long-term customer.</p>
<p>Building on the point about competitors above, do a search online for one of your products and be honest: would you choose your own company’s item first? If not, why not? Do the same exercise on an online marketplace.</p>
<h3>9. Avoid overly promotional phrases</h3>
<p>Words like “stylish,” or even “luxury” might work well enough to generate click-throughs and purchases. Sticking in phrases like “Buy one, get 50% off” in titles is a bad idea too. They could even run you afoul of search engines if you’re trying to fine-tune Google Shopping product title optimization.</p>
<p>What shoppers want instead are details that matter. This could include phrases like “oversized,” “skinny fit,” “waterproof” or “insulated, among others.”</p>
<h3>10. Check for capitalization, grammar, and overall quality</h3>
<p>Not every word in your title needs to be capitalized. Unless it’s not a proper brand name, stick with capitalizing the first letter of the first word instead.</p>
<p>Needless to say, optimizing product titles isn’t finished until everything has been proofread to ensure it makes sense and that everything is spelled correctly. This is also where you can consider the use of symbols, such as dashes or commas, to help separate key elements or ideas within your title.</p>
<p>Remember that your product titles are part of the first impression you make with customers, so the copy needs to be as professional as possible.</p>
<h3>Explore Product Title Optimization Tools</h3>
<p>You may want to establish your quality standards by optimizing product titles for an initial set of products, but in some cases, your inventory can include hundreds of products or more. The effort involved in product title optimization for everything you sell can become a considerable burden. There are some free online tools available to assist with this, such as product title generators, but the best automation solutions scale across your product feeds.</p>
<p>Highstreet.io, for example, has been developing a patent-pending system based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance every aspect of product title optimization. This approach starts with identifying accurate, precise categories and product types, and then extracting the most popular search keywords. Before going live, however, users have an opportunity to review optimized product titles and accept them at their own discretion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As peak shopping periods like Black Friday get closer, there is no time to waste. This is the time you should start looking at your big-ticket items and consider how best to promote them.<br />
It’s when you develop ad campaigns with creative visuals that showcase your most attractive offers. And if you’re serious about having a successful Black Friday, it’s the moment you optimize your Amazon product data feed, too.</p>
<p>While the company sells plenty of its own merchandise to eCommerce buyers, for example, as many as<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/259782/third-party-seller-share-of-amazon-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 60% of paid units are sold on Amazon by third-party merchants</a> across a wide range of categories.</p>
<p>The size of the marketplace indeed means there is plenty of competition on Amazon. However, the company continues to offer innovations that help other brands stand out. This includes<a href="https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/digital-commerce/amazon-inspire-shoppable-content-feed-discovery-immersive-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the “Inspire” feed</a> introduced in late 2022, as well as<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/14/amazon-updates-visual-search-ar-search-and-more-in-challenge-to-google/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAopAwc6S05QqiF6tx59ynRjjeBUlHoZxgFVPDyh7Z9mgcElKZRbY3YbWanzF3xmDZjmX5PvqKyyOE3zAUqBg_qbytNeeGsx5BySP_4MBE3vVukgpOzDzzzYkZlHa9p33petYoOtCAfbVhfMvhGna2gOJ-UleoqYW23WcOSPRIXr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> product discovery tools</a> based on augmented reality and<a href="https://highstreet.io/using-visual-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> visual search</a>.</p>
<h2>How to better list your products on Amazon Marketplace</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16372" title="Listing Products on Amazon Marketplace" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/amazon-list.jpg" alt="Products on Amazon Marketplace" width="750" height="500" /></p>
<p>Much like other online marketplaces,<a href="https://highstreet.io/amazon-product-listings-all-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> getting products listed on Amazon</a> involves some basic steps.</p>
<p>You’ll need to choose the appropriate product category,<a href="https://highstreet.io/your-ultimate-guide-to-amazon-pricing-strategy-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> determine your pricing strategy</a>, select a<a href="https://highstreet.io/amazon-fba-inventory-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> fulfillment</a> method, and use keywords Amazon visitors will likely key into the search bar.</p>
<p>Some of these steps will involve some manual effort, but to scale effectively and maximize your eCommerce sales opportunities, you’ll also want to harness the power of automation for your Amazon product data feeds.</p>
<h2>Benefits of having an optimized Amazon product data feed</h2>
<p>Amazon’s marketplace customers have the same expectations as those who discover your brand through your website or any other channel. They want to see accurate product listings, up to date, and reflect what’s available for purchase.</p>
<p>As you begin to list more products on Amazon, however, maintaining the quality of your data can become incredibly difficult. Updating pricing, available inventory, and other aspects of hundreds of listings or more isn’t a great use of employees’ time.</p>
<p>Beyond taking those chores away, the benefits of automating your Amazon product data feeds include:</p>
<h3>1. Listings that do your products justice</h3>
<p>When consumers walk into a physical store, you only get one chance to make a first impression. That’s why retailers often put out their best products on a table or rack where discerning customers can notice all the key details.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to online product listings. Your Amazon product data feed should be optimized to ensure you’re providing everything from product titles, descriptions, and images that convert visitors into buyers.</p>
<h3>2. Product information customers can trust</h3>
<p>Without automation, an Amazon product data feed might only be updated once every few days. That poses a risk that customers will not realize the price of an item they’re considering has changed, or that it’s temporarily out of stock.</p>
<p>Your goal should be to provide real-time updates that reflect the current state of every product in your inventory. That way, you can more easily offer promotions and discounts that drive more activity during periods like Black Friday.</p>
<h3>3. Can’t-miss visibility in Amazon search results</h3>
<p>Much like when they’re looking up information on Google, many consumers probably don’t want to go past the first page of results when they’re searching on Amazon.</p>
<p>When you put in the work upfront to research the right keywords, an Amazon product data feed will maximize the likelihood your items will rank higher than competitors. And of course, with its one-click buy button, Amazon makes it easy for customers to take the next step when they find what they want.</p>
<h3>4. Access to a global market</h3>
<p>Unlike the limitations of a physical storefront, eCommerce allows sellers to transcend borders and other geographic boundaries. This is especially true on Amazon, which enjoys<a href="https://www.blankspace.eu/blog-posts-en/amazon-marketplaces-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> billions in sales in markets such as the U.K., Germany, and Japan</a>.</p>
<p>No matter where they’re based, though, your customers should have a consistent experience in terms of the level of detail and timeliness of the data in your listings. Automating your product feed on Amazon will ensure that, even if the same customer decides to browse across more than one Amazon regional site.</p>
<h3>5. An end to constant inventory worries</h3>
<p>It may sound like a nice problem to have, but when a product proves more popular than expected there can be more disappointed customers than those feeling satisfied. Running out of stock can hurt your reputation as a brand, both with customers and Amazon itself (more on that later in this post).</p>
<p>Think of your product data feed as a trusted assistant who makes managing inventory levels both easy and efficient. Stock getting low? You can set an alert to be notified and take action before it’s too late.</p>
<h3>6. Out-price the competition</h3>
<p>Depending on the product category, there may be little to truly differentiate your brand from your rivals, other than what you’re asking customers to pay.</p>
<p>Instead of treating this as a race to the bottom in terms of revenue, however, you can use Amazon’s Repricing tool or your analytics to determine what will make the most sense for your business.</p>
<p>Then, when you’re ready, you can use your Amazon product data feed to get new prices up with speed, especially amid moments like Black Friday when you know there are likely a lot of people browsing the marketplace for a deal.</p>
<h3>7. A stronger partnership with Amazon</h3>
<p>Amazon has to manage a slew of seller relationships, and its priority is understandably to ensure its marketplace meets the highest quality standards.</p>
<p>If your listings aren’t properly formatted, for example, or are missing key attributes, it can jeopardize your brand’s future in Amazon’s marketplace.</p>
<p>This is another example of where relying on manual, human effort doesn’t make sense. A product data feed optimized for Amazon reduces the risk of errors. That not only means you’ll avoid being suspended from Amazon’s marketplace program; you could become one of its most trusted eCommerce partners.</p>
<h3>8. Greater capabilities to execute data-driven decision-making</h3>
<p>Amazon wants its sellers to share its customer-obsessed approach to eCommerce. That’s why the company offers analytics tools that let them track their performance. Having the data is only the first step, though.</p>
<p>As you get a better understanding of what’s selling and why, you can begin to make tweaks to your listings that will supercharge your conversion rate. It might be adding more details to a single product listing, offering a promotion based on a possible best-seller or simply ensuring you hold onto the right level of inventory for seasonal products.</p>
<h3>9. An accelerated path to eCommerce expansion</h3>
<p>Creating an Amazon product data feed isn’t an isolated IT project that takes up time and resources. It represents the beginning of a multi-channel sales strategy that can continue to offer dividends.</p>
<p>With your product data optimized, for instance, you can begin to look at other digital channels that are likely to attract your target customers.</p>
<p>This can include<a href="https://highstreet.io/tiktok-product-feeds-for-stronger-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> social media channels like TikTok</a>, for instance, or even one of the growing number of online marketplaces being offered by brands that are already household names, such as<a href="https://highstreet.io/unlock-the-potential-of-macys-marketplace-with-integration-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s</a>.</p>
<h3>10. A customer experience that builds brand loyalty</h3>
<p>Customers who initially discover your brand on Amazon’s marketplace may decide to visit your website to learn more. They might pay greater attention when your products show up on Instagram or Facebook. Some will even opt-in to receive your e-mail newsletter for additional promotions and discounts.</p>
<p>The product data feed you set up on Amazon will let you build a relationship with these customers based on a positive experience, where they find what they want and get it sent their way. When they’re satisfied, it’s not just Amazon that benefits – your brand will too.</p>
<h2>How to create an Amazon product data feed</h2>
<p>Setting up an Amazon product data field involves the following:</p>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Open an Amazon seller central account so you have access to send your product data feed to the marketplace. You’ll need to provide a credit card, tax identification information, and basic business information such as your business name, address, and contact details.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Link your business bank account to your brand’s Amazon seller account.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Choose the local marketplaces Amazon operates that are most relevant to your business in terms of your target customers.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Choose your preferred billing plan – unless you’re selling as an individual this will be a professional plan aimed at corporate entities for a nominal monthly fee.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Complete your tax interview – Amazon needs to verify the professional status of your business.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Enter basic product information – This is where you can clarify whether you’re the manufacturer of the products you’re selling or whether you’re reselling on an OEM’s behalf. You’ll also quantify the volume of products you’ll be selling on Amazon and whether or not you use UPC codes for your products.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Add all the necessary data attributes such as product title, category, SKU, price, images, and URL of each item. Don’t forget critical details such as shipping costs if you’re not using Amazon’s fulfillment service. Be as detailed as possible to provide the best experience for Amazon customers.</li>
<li>Upload your inventory file: Within your Amazon seller account you’ll visit the inventory page and deliver the content in either text or XML format.</li>
</ol>
<p>Be prepared to make changes to this feed as you manage your stock levels, customer demand, and many other factors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There may be a lot of dancing, lip-syncing, and comedic skits when you scroll through your feed, but don’t be fooled: selling on TikTok is serious business, especially when you’re ready to showcase your products to its vast global audience.</p>
<p>In its 2023<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/tiktok-2023-whats-next-trend-report?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> What’s Next Trend Report</a>, TikTok provided its assessment of what keeps consumers coming back to its app for hours on end: the focus on relatable and uplifting has created a community that is ready to take action. Ads<b> with a high entertainment value scored 15% higher for purchase intent.</b></p>
<p>Having a TikTok product feed is just as important as making an ad funny or heartwarming, though. Consumers need to see products with accurate, up-to-date details before they click a “buy” button. When it’s done right, however, selling on <a href="https://highstreet.io/start-selling-on-tik-tok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok could be an important growth driver</a>.</p>
<h2>Benefits of selling on TikTok</h2>
<p>Just consider the results of a survey published in early 2023 that showed<a href="https://getcircuit.com/teams/blog/tiktok-ecommerce-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 83% of consumers believe TikTok will become the home shopping network of our digital age</a>. This has attracted <a href="https://www.theroot.com/rihanna-is-looking-for-the-ultimate-fenty-fan-on-tiktok-1849613824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big brands like Fenty Beauty</a>, which got headlines for running contests and other marketing tactics on TikTok. Another study found <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/tiktok-social-marketing-teens-snap-instagram-piper-sandler/646930/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clothing is a top spending priority for women using TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>Is it worth selling on TikTok? Yes, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s the third-largest social platform, with<a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/charts/global-tiktok-user-stats/#:~:text=TikTok%20will%20have%20834.3%20million,phenomenon%20has%20been%20incredibly%20quick." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> more than 800 million users</a> (and still growing!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Achieving reach within large consumer segments matters, especially when you’re selling luxury products across multiple geographies. Marketing on TikTok should be just as big a priority as being present on other popular channels, such as search engines or display advertising.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though it attracts users of all ages,<a href="https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/tiktok-age-demographics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the largest TikTok segment is between 18-34</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For brands in segments like fashion, this represents one of the most covetable demographics, based on disposable income and typically high levels of shopping and spending activity. It’s an audience where the marketing return on investment (ROI) may be higher.</p>
<ul>
<li>TikTok’s<a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-updates/tiktok/tiktok-discovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> “For You” page</a> is designed to help people discover people brands they don’t know.<br />
Other social platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, organize feeds primarily based on content from someone you’re following. That can make it more difficult to raise brand awareness among new prospects. TikTok’s approach has become so successful it is being replicated on other social platforms, including Twitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>TikTok also provides<b> brands flexibility</b> in terms of creating effective marketing content to reach their business goals, such as driving more revenue, increasing share of wallet among existing customers, and increasing brand affinity. Marketers can create their TikToks using little more than a smartphone, for example, showcasing stylish products in a way that feels native to the platform. Brands can also <b>partner with influencers</b> and creators who already have large followings on TikTok that point them to their TikTok Shop.</p>
<blockquote><p>Get the Details on <a href="https://highstreet.io/start-selling-on-tik-tok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Sell Products on TikTok</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>What Is TikTok Shop?</h2>
<p>Initially available in locations such as Southeast Asia,<a href="https://shop.tiktok.com/business/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> TikTok has continued to roll out TikTok Shop</a>, which allows merchants to display their products to its community, along with directly integrating e-commerce capabilities for shoppers for a smooth purchasing experience.</p>
<p>TikTok Shop also includes tools to manage campaigns, analytics to track marketing performance, and access to collaborate directly with creators.</p>
<p>Selling on TikTok via TikTok Shop isn’t limited to shopping ad campaigns but merchant-led live videos and in-stream videos. For many brands, however, the most natural starting point will be simply setting up a <b>TikTok product feed </b>to ensure their products are being featured where their customers are most likely to be browsing online. Before that, though, it’s important to understand how your ads will show up on the platform.</p>
<h2>TikTok Shopping Ads Formats</h2>
<p>There are also several options for formatting your TikTok ads. You might want to consider trying them all and doubling down on those that prove most successful after running a test for some time.</p>
<p>Live shopping ads, for instance, are probably best suited for a time-sensitive event, such as the launch or availability of a new product. They will be seen in real-time as people are scrolling through TikTok and can be a chance to answer questions and get a work-through of products in detail.</p>
<p>Video shopping ads appear on the “For You” page of the app, which means they might work well as a way to raise brand awareness among consumers who don’t yet know your brand very well. The good thing about these ads is that the videos are shoppable, meaning people can place orders directly if they like what they see.</p>
<p>Catalog listing ads are probably the most familiar format if you’ve run campaigns through channels such as Google. Setting up a TikTok product catalog allows you to curate the items you want to curate and highlight to the app’s discerning audience.</p>
<p>No matter which format you choose, you need to make sure your ads feature the most relevant items from your catalog, which is where a TikTok product feed comes in.</p>
<h2>How To Create A TikTok Product Feed</h2>
<p>Much like other <a href="https://highstreet.io/reach-customers-social-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social commerce platforms</a>, you can begin<a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/create-manage-catalogs?redirected=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> setting up a TikTok product feed</a> once you’ve created an account on the TikTok Business Center. This requires time and attention to detail.</p>
<h3>1. Create your TikTok product feed catalog</h3>
<p>With the “Catalog” area of the TikTok Business Center, choose “Add Catalog.” Enter details such as your catalog name and business center account as well as your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Default currency</li>
<li>Targeting location</li>
<li>Industry</li>
</ul>
<p>Select “Create” to finish setting up your catalog.</p>
<h3>2. Choose your product upload option</h3>
<p>From there, you can begin to add items to your TikTok product feed in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>by entering detailed information about each product</li>
<li>by working with a partner that offers a solution to automate your TikTok product feed. In this scenario, we’re walking through all the steps in manually adding products</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve created a catalog, navigate to the area called “Manage” and then “Products.” This will present you with a template to download.</p>
<p>In the same area, select “Add products” and click on “Manually add.” Click “Next” and then begin entering all the required product information. When you’re done, click on “Import.”</p>
<h3>3. Enter product attributes</h3>
<p>TikTok’s Catalog Manager requires<a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/catalog-product-parameters?redirected=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> nine different mandatory fields</a> for every product you sell on its platform. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product images</li>
<li>SKU ID</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Video URLs.</li>
</ul>
<p>To maximize the potential of selling on TikTok, you probably want to consider the 27 optional fields as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tiktok-Feed-Structure.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16173 size-full" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tiktok-Feed-Structure-mni3.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="819" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Choose a storage format for product attribute data</h3>
<p>Most brands have many different products to include in their feed. Make sure you store them as a CSV, XML, ZIP, or other appropriate format</p>
<h3>5. Establish your feed schedule</h3>
<p>Depending on how often products get updated within your catalog, you may want to schedule feeds on a daily or even hourly basis. Remember that consumers will be expecting all your catalog data to be accurate and error-free. If you’re choosing hourly, you’ll need to indicate the precise time the file updates should begin.</p>
<h3>6. Choose a product update method</h3>
<p>If you’ll be primarily adding or updating details to the items in your TikTok product feed, upload the file you need for each one. If you’re replacing your data feed, you’ll need to upload a new one where the existing one was located. Choose “Import” to complete this process.</p>
<h3>7. Group products into sets</h3>
<p>Find “Product Set” within the “Category area and choose “Create a product set.” From there, you can either manually select one product at a time by clicking on “Manually Select Products” or “Use Filters” to make it easier to create product campaigns. Click “Confirm” when you’re done.</p>
<h3>8. Add new product sources</h3>
<p>Although you need to choose an initial source when you’re first setting up your TikTok product feed, you can introduce others later on. This is done simply by choosing “Add Products” after selecting “Product Sources” in the “Configure” area. Remember that TikTok needs to review all the ads that run on its platform – it suggests only having one data feed per catalog to expedite this process.</p>
<h3>9. Edit and add products</h3>
<p>There is still plenty of opportunity to make changes to your product information after they’ve been added to your catalog. You’ll find the edit button by hovering over the product name, which will allow you to make changes in each field. The product SKU ID has to remain the same, however. If you need to delete a product because it has been discontinued or your brand is no longer carrying it, click a checkmark next to the product and choose “Disable” from a nearby drop-down menu.</p>
<h3>10. Establish TikTok product catalog rules</h3>
<p>Sometimes you’ll want to make minor changes to your product information, and TikTok offers a rules-based mechanism for doing so. Just choose “Product Sources” within your catalog, click on the source name, and select “Add Rules” under the settings tab.</p>
<p>You’ll have several options here. You can opt for “Value Replacement” to swap one value in a product with another, set “Default Value” or even “Mapping” to map a value from your file into a TikTok-supported column. “Regex Replace” is a way of substituting inventory details in your TikTok product feed file with a new value.</p>
<p><a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/create-manage-catalogs?redirected=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok’s Business help center offers even more details</a> on every step in this process.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that manually adding products isn’t a one-time exercise. Pricing, for instance, will only be displayed in the currency you chose when your product was created. If you use TikTok to sell into new markets, it will have to be updated. The same goes for changes to product descriptions, SKU IDs, and more.</p>
<h2>Why you should use a product feed management platform for selling on TikTok</h2>
<p>Automating product feed management takes away the hours otherwise spent adding and updating items to your catalog, while also<b> improving the accuracy of all the data</b> your customers will see.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://highstreet.io/product-feed-management/social-ecommerce/">Highstreet.io’s Social Commerce service</a>, for example, everything from feed configuration to product data optimization and synchronization is managed for you. Flexible configurations allow you to keep on top of changing channel requirements, and you can connect your analytics platform to track the performance of products you’re selling on TikTok.</p>
<p>Though it’s just one of many possible channels you can turn into a shoppable storefront, TikTok’s popularity is impossible to ignore.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s world of eCommerce, marketers are expected to perform at superhuman speeds, much like Marvel superheroes, while facing increasing workloads and limited resources. If you are one of these superheroes you know that to get ahead of the competition you need to prioritize the work that gets you the best results. When planning your marketing activities to deliver the best ROI, product feed optimization should be at the top of the list.</p>
<p>Your product feeds are your most valuable marketing assets to scale your sales on marketplaces and marketing channels. To meet your goals, the quality and relevancy of your product information within your feed should be exceptional to provide a successful customer shopping experience. The saying &#8220;Garbage in, Garbage Out&#8221; couldn&#8217;t be more accurate.</p>
<p>Read on to discover everything you need to know about product feed optimization. This includes translating feed technical requirements into understandable and actionable tasks to improve your product listing results.</p>
<h2>What is Product Feed Optimization?</h2>
<p>The term &#8220;product feed optimization&#8221; sounds vague and mysterious, but when you break it down to the basics, the concept is simple to understand.</p>
<p>Product feed optimization is a process that e-commerce businesses use to ensure their products are visible to potential customers on various online sales channels. A well-optimized product feed helps marketers to generate more relevant ads based on searches, structure ads in a way that appeals to customers&#8217; needs, and control the timing of when and what ads customers see, defined by the seller.</p>
<h2>Why is Data Feed Optimization Important?</h2>
<p>Your eCommerce operation relies on the successful integration and synchronization of product information, ensuring its consistency across all of your platforms and channels. Shopping Feed optimizations affect your campaign success by fully leveraging the number of available offers and by accurately matching ads to products users are interested in.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine a product feed having so much impact on your marketing performance. To help you understand why optimization is important, let’s break down the benefits.</p>
<h3>Top 5 Benefits of Product Feed Optimization<b></b></h3>
<div style="padding-left: 15px;">
<ul>
<li><b>Better visibility &amp; search relevancy<br />
</b>By optimizing product feeds with the right keywords, descriptions, and product attributes, you can improve your product listings&#8217; search relevancy, making it easier for customers to find them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Accurate showcasing of your inventory<br />
</b>Shopping ads require specific product information, such as product name, description, price, and availability. By optimizing your product feeds with frequently refreshed data you ensure customers see the most up-to-date information for accurate pricing, product details, and inventory.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Increased conversions from your listings<br />
</b>By providing up-to-date product information, customer trust and confidence increases for your products and brand, leading to higher product listing clicks and conversions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Save time and resources by automating the product listing process<br />
</b>Product feed optimization tools allow you to easily create and manage product feeds across multiple platforms, reducing the time and effort required to list products manually.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Fewer Google Merchant Center (GMC) disapprovals<br />
</b>Google has strict requirements for shopping feeds. When your Google Shopping feed and website product pages are optimized, you have fewer product disapprovals. This process increases the exposure of your ads.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>More granular campaign segmentation<br />
</b>By providing accurate and optimized product properties to Google Merchant Center, advertisers can segment their campaigns by designing ad groups based on the selection of accurate categories, taxonomies, other properties, or other custom attributes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Master Data Feed Optimization</h2>
<p>How do you begin your feed optimization process? You start with creating a quality master feed which is used as the basis for making additional data feeds for each marketing channel like Google, Facebook, Instagram, and others.</p>
<p><b>Here are the steps to build the basis for an optimized master data feed:</b><b></b></p>
<div style="padding-left: 15px;">
<ul>
<li><b>Understand where and how your product data is stored<br />
</b>The first step is understanding what data you need, where it resides (eCommerce platform, PIM, spreadsheet, etc.), and how it&#8217;s displayed on your website. This process can be very simple or complex. Talking to a <a href="http://highstreet.io/product-feed-management">Product Feed Management provider</a> to help you at this stage could alleviate problems with your product listings down the road.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Outline where (countries) you want to promote your products and on what channels<br />
</b>When you get into <a href="https://highstreet.io/create-a-multi-country-product-feed-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-country and multi-currency product feeds</a>, simple things like the structure of your website URLs, the price shown on your website, and the product information on your pages should align with the channel&#8217;s requirements you are selling on.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Identify the data you need for the channel you are selling on<br />
</b>Each channel&#8217;s requirements may be different. Doing your research to stay on top of these ever-changing requirements helps to identify the gaps in missing and incorrect product data. This step is sometimes an eye-opener for sellers that didn&#8217;t realize they had conflicting and missing information.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Data </span>Feed Optimization for Marketing &amp; Marketplace Channels</h2>
<p>Small retailers or brands usually start expanding their reach by selling a few products on marketplaces and advertising some products on shopping channels. At this stage, a simple product feed plugin to create a feed may be &#8220;good enough&#8221; to start running product listing ads on channels like Google Shopping. As you grow and expand, you should be on the lookout to find a full-service product feed management and marketplace integration solution to free up your team&#8217;s time to manage all of the feed optimizations needed to scale your sales.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve learned about master feeds and channel feeds, let’s get into more detail on optimizing Google Shopping feeds.</p>
<h2>Important Tips for Google Shopping Feed Optimization</h2>
<p>There are over 1 billion shopping sessions per day on Google Shopping. It is no wonder it’s the most popular search advertising option for both small and large eCommerce companies.</p>
<p>Reviewing the data in your Google Shopping feed attributes to ensure it’s compliant with Google’s requirements and relevant to the products you’re selling, is the basis for a quality feed.</p>
<p><strong>Use these shopping feed optimization tips as a framework to create better feeds for improved product listings.</strong></p>
<h3><b>Top Google Shopping Attributes to Optimize Within Your Feed</b></h3>
<h4><b>Title</b></h4>
<p>The more relevant your title is to what a person on Google is searching for, the better your product listing&#8217;s performance will be. They advise advertisers to avoid promotional text and align their landing page&#8217;s title with the title in their feed.</p>
<p>A product feed management solution allows you to create rules so that if specific attributes aren&#8217;t available, you can replace them with other details or even add a plural to make the title read better.</p>
<p><i>Product Title Example:</i></p>
<p>Brand [blank] Product Name (when available) [blank] product type (when available and not in the product name)[,] gender (plural with &#8216;s)[,] [material])[,] color[,] size</p>
<h4><b>Color</b></h4>
<p>Google Merchant Center recommends if you use a unique color, on your landing page, you should submit that value through the [color] attribute. Google crawls your landing page and matches the color in your feed to what&#8217;s on your landing page. If there is a mismatch, then Google Merchant Center could produce an error.</p>
<p>They recommend adding a more common color name, like &#8220;Red&#8221; or &#8220;Black&#8221;, to your title [title]. These accepted terms help ensure that your products are correctly categorized and displayed in relevant search results.</p>
<h4><b>Category</b></h4>
<p>Instead of leaving Google&#8217;s product category [google_product_category] attribute blank, use it to help create findable products by people searching for them in your category. If you don&#8217;t provide category information within your feed, you run the risk of Google automatically categorizing your products.</p>
<p>An example of a well-chosen product category for a dress is <i>Clothing &amp; Accessories &gt; Clothing &gt; Dresses</i></p>
<p><b>Get more in-depth information on </b><a href="https://highstreet.io/google-shopping-optimization-product-category/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Google Product Category Optimization</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<h4><b>GTIN</b></h4>
<p>The Global Trade Item Number, or GTIN, is no longer a required attribute for your Google Shopping feed but is still worth using in your optimization process. When you&#8217;re running Google Shopping ads, you&#8217;re bidding against competitors potentially selling the same or similar products. The GTIN code helps customers find your specific product listing easier and faster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know the “e” in eCommerce stands for “electronic,” but the word “easy” would make sense too.<br />
It should be easy for consumers to find the products they covet. They also want an easy way to discover the best deals.</p>
<p>For the brands, meanwhile, an easier approach to addressing those needs allows you to grow. The business case for data feed management, therefore, is a pretty easy one to make.</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing concerns about the state of the global economy, for example, recent data suggests consumer spending online shows no signs of slowing down.<br />
In the U.S. alone<a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2022/11/10/adobe-analytics-early-holiday-spending-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> there was a more than 10% increase in eCommerce activity totaling US$72 billion</a> in October. Some categories are seeing buying activity skyrocket, such as a 142% jump in outerwear apparel.</p>
<p>According to other research, however,<a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/state-of-ecommerce-pandemic/#toc-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the surge in eCommerce sales comes with new challenges</a>. These not only include supply chain woes but also the cost to acquire and keep customers.<br />
That may be because brands have to balance providing the best products at the best price while ensuring they show up in all the myriad channels their target customers might be browsing.</p>
<p><strong>Data feed management technology</strong> speaks directly to these eCommerce hurdles and is the best way to begin overcoming them.</p>
<h2>What is Data Feed Management?</h2>
<p>By facilitating the distribution and management of product listings, <strong>data feed management helps online sellers</strong> transform everything from how they monitor their inventory to the level of personalized advertising they can bring to their customer experience.</p>
<p>The<b> best data feed management platform</b> should not only <b>allow you to populate all the necessary digital channels with your product listings</b> but also synchronize them to ease the process of updating or making changes to them.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Data Feed Optimization</h2>
<p>Why is data optimization important? Because you never get a second chance to make a first impression – including the impression you make with a digital ad.</p>
<p>When consumers type a search into Google, for instance, they may only spend a few seconds deciding whether the ad that comes up in response is worth a click.<br />
The quality of the elements that make up that ad – the title, the description, the price, the category, and the availability are just some of the factors that will convince them to buy from you, one way or the other.</p>
<p>Providing that data can vary significantly from one digital channel to the next. This can mean considerable work for those behind the scenes to tailor product feeds for every affiliate network, marketplace, or comparison site available to them.</p>
<h2>How Product Data Feeds can help</h2>
<p><b>Optimizing product data feeds puts you in a position to sell anywhere your customers are</b> searching for their next purchase. Instead of worrying about the unique requirements for each channel, data feed management allows you to <strong>focus on creating ads that are more creative and compelling</strong> to entice a greater number of purchases.</p>
<p>Creating product data feeds can also avoid manually exporting your product catalog and creating a disconnect between the products customers want and <a href="https://highstreet.io/inventory-management-tools-for-multichannel-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what you have in stock</a>.<br />
The greater consumers’ confidence in the accuracy of your listings, the more likely they will reward you with repeat business.</p>
<h2>Product Data Feed Management tools for better listings</h2>
<p>Listing your products across a variety of digital channels is a way of ensuring you’ve left no stone unturned.</p>
<p>While<a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/us-ecommerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Amazon accounts for an estimated 40% of eCommerce activity</a>, for example, that leaves a significant percentage of other channels and <a href="https://highstreet.io/online-marketplaces-usa-expand-ecommerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketplaces where opportunities abound</a>. This is especially true for luxury brands that want to take an international approach to market to the most discerning, high-net-worth consumers.</p>
<p>Besides marketplaces, connecting to your total addressable market could mean <a href="https://highstreet.io/reach-customers-social-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pursuing social commerce</a> on channels such as Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok. Review sites and price comparison sites are other important touchpoints to consider.</p>
<h2>Why choose Highstreet.io as your Data Feed Solution Provider</h2>
<p>Creating the perfect ads to match users’ intent and deliver the right information becomes faster and easier with the right solutions in place.</p>
<p>First, <strong>automation</strong> takes away manual efforts that are both time-consuming and prone to human error.</p>
<p>Secondly, <strong>synchronizing your listings with multiple channels at once</strong> allows you and your team to focus on analyzing the performance of your marketing campaigns to drive better results.</p>
<p><strong>Hightstreet.io’s feed management platform</strong> was designed with these needs in mind. That’s why we offer <b>effective and efficient backend synchronizations with the most popular eCommerce platforms.</b> This includes Salesforce Commerce Cloud, IBM WCX, Magento, Shopify, and Oracle.</p>
<p>Once you’ve gotten set up, you’ll discover how to manage disparate data objects such as product data, inventory data, prices, orders, stores, and promotions.<br />
This kind of granularity will bring greater precision to your efforts to connect your customers to the right information.</p>
<p>By linking your feeds with Google Analytics’ key performance indicators, meanwhile, Highsteet.io <b>enriches feeds based on product performance</b>. These feeds are based on real-time data, using application programming interfaces (APIs) in both data sources and output feeds.</p>
<p><strong>The true power of the Highstreet.io product data feed management</strong> platform also comes through <b>optimizations based on artificial intelligence</b> (AI), with automated keyword extractions and category mappings. You can block the delivery of a feed based on certain conditions and receive customized alerts as part of your monitoring extensions.</p>
<p>Of course, getting started with product feeds successfully depends on having a partner who’s ready to work with you. <strong>Highstreet.io simplifies business process management</strong> (BPM) support to handle a variety of feed sequences and conditional behavior and leverage scripting techniques to assist with any use cases.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shopping behavior is changing, and when we researched how it changed, what we discovered was eye-opening. Remember when “Activewear” became the new “Officewear” in 2020? A new online work environment emerged consisting of cozy sweatpants on the bottom and a Zoom call-appropriate shirt on top. Today that dress code and the need for office-related items is evolving fast as more companies mandate their staff back to the office.</p>
<p>As the New York Times reported,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/29/business/casual-workwear-clothes-office.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> Nordstrom </strong><strong>saw a 152 percent increase in searches on its website for the term “workwear”</strong></a> in February 2022. Looking toward the Fall season, more employees are expected to return to work, and retailers look forward to a boost in back-to-office shopping items.</p>
<p>What does this mean for your brand? There’s an opportunity to rethink your consumer’s online shopping experience. The main considerations are your online presence and the positioning of your products. In this post, you’ll learn more about your customer’s back-to-office mindset, their changing shopping habits, tips on how to engage with them, and how product catalog optimization can help you reach maximum product exposure and connect you to the right customers.</p>
<h2>Your Customer’s Mindset Going Back to The Office</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12899" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2woman-back-to-the-office.jpg" alt="customers mindset back to office" width="750" height="475" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2woman-back-to-the-office.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2woman-back-to-the-office-480x304.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>In your customer’s mind, it’s time to look good and feel good at work. After two years of on and off lockdowns, employees returning to the office are searching for back-to-work clothing, and it’s expected that as more businesses bring back staff, the searches for office-related clothing and products will increase.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/1502032946445783051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Trends</a> reported that “business casual outfits” and “casual work outfits” searches hit an all-time high in the US back in March of 2022. But new online searches aren’t the only changes related to a workforce returning to the office.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12889" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/business-casual-trends-google.png" alt="Business casual trends google" width="750" height="167" /></p>
<h2>What Changing Consumer Behavior Means for Retailers</h2>
<p>There’s another behavior shift related to where and how people shop. The opportunity to shop online while commuting to and from work and buy in-store before work, at lunch, and after work.<br />
How do you <strong>engage with your current customers and attract new ones</strong> as their spending patterns change?</p>
<p>Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integrate with new <a href="https://highstreet.io/top-online-marketplace-sites-for-ecommerce-merchants-to-sell-at-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online Marketplaces</a></strong> and market your products on shopping channels to be where your audience is<br />
Reach people browsing and searching for products by category, brand, and other factors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promote products in your physical stores </strong>to capitalize on in-store shopping trends<br />
Use <strong><a href="https://highstreet.io/local-inventory-ads-turn-online-browsers-into-in-store-shoppers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Local inventory ads</a></strong> to attract local buyers and advertise products based on audience location.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build better customer experiences on social media</strong><br />
Integrate your products with <strong><a href="https://highstreet.io/reach-customers-social-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Commerce Platforms</a></strong> like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and TikTok. The more seamless your customer’s shopping experience, the more chance they’ll come back and buy more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Attract More Customers, Wherever They Are</h2>
<p>The saying “The one thing you can count on is change.” is the reality retailers are accustomed to. This is why having a solution to adapt to your customer&#8217;s shifting lifestyle is so important.</p>
<p>A popular method for keeping your inventory responsive to these market changes is Product Catalog Optimization. It’s the technical process of <strong>optimizing the product data in your catalog to help online shoppers find your products</strong>, make an informed buying decision, and provide a better shopping experience with your brand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12893" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/woman-shopping-online.jpg" alt="product catalog optimization attracts customers" width="750" height="475" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/woman-shopping-online.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/woman-shopping-online-480x304.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Think of how a supermarket continually merchandises its stock based on consumer demand, seasonal items, and promotions. The same result occurs when retailers <strong>use product catalog optimization to attract customers</strong> to their products everywhere they’re spending time online.</p>
<h4>The New Omnichannel Commerce Strategy</h4>
<p>Your catalog optimization doesn&#8217;t end with the products sold on your website. Whether you’re a retailer focused on selling in a local area or a global brand selling in multiple countries, <strong>your product data needs to be structured properly and updated frequently on every commerce channel</strong>. This practice is a <a href="https://highstreet.io/new-omnichannel-shopping-experience-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">core success factor of an omnichannel commerce strategy.</a></p>
<p>Commerce channels like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google Shopping, Amazon, eBay, and Rakuten need dedicated and optimized product feeds.</p>
<h2>Product Catalog Optimization Made Easy</h2>
<p>Adapting to your customer’s changing shopping behaviors and adopting new commerce channels is part of a retailer’s job, but a lack of experienced resources and specialized techniques can be a roadblock.<br />
This is where a highly technical product feed management service can help. Solutions like <a href="https://highstreet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Highstreet.io</a> help you <strong>optimize your catalog and product data for every channel your products are listed.</strong></p>

Without a Multi-Country product feed strategy, you’re losing out on new, prospective customers who want what you have to offer.</p>
<p>So, how exactly do you create accurate, localized feeds that display your products to customers in various countries? The answer depends on what channels you’re using to sell your products.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll take a look at how to create a Facebook and aGoogle international product feed strategy for new, global markets.</p>
<h2>Google Shopping Multi-Country and Multi-Language Feeds</h2>
<p><a href="https://highstreet.io/?attachment_id=9493"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-9493 size-large" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-shopping-multicountry-feed-1-1024x341.jpg" alt="google-shopping-multicountry-feed" width="1024" height="341" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-shopping-multicountry-feed-1-1024x341.jpg 1024w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-shopping-multicountry-feed-1-980x327.jpg 980w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-shopping-multicountry-feed-1-480x160.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p>To set up your Multi-Country and Multi-Language feeds let’s start by looking at <strong>product feed requirements for certain countries in Google Merchant Center.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>Create your primary feed, and select your language and country</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; margin-top: -18px;">As a starting point, it’s a good idea to see if your desired country appears on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/160637#countrytable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved list</a></span> of countries for Google Shopping. Once a country and language have been selected, it’s time to set the rules for your product data.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>Set up specific rules for your product data</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; margin-top: -18px;">Feed rules are what help make your product feeds compliant and optimal for Google Merchant Center. Once you have selected your country and language, set your specific product feed rules to minimize errors.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>Use supplemental feeds</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; margin-top: -18px;">Supplemental feeds are additional sets of crucial product data that will help further differentiate your products by highlighting additional attributes. The purpose of a supplemental data feed is to add missing data to your primary feed like a product’s sale price in the location’s native currency and language. Having both primary and supplemental feeds are highly beneficial for differentiating your products from your competitors.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><strong>Understand Country Groups in Google Merchant Center</strong></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; margin-top: -18px;">Google Merchant Center has created pre-determined country groups (Group A and Group B), which allow your product listings to appear to more customers outside of your core area. Depending on the primary country you have selected, your product listing will automatically appear in another country if both countries are within the same Country Group. This option gives you the advantage of marketing your products in more than just the initially selected country.</p>
<p>Now that you have selected your primary country, you’ve enabled your products to appear to your intended audience in a given area.</p>
<p>By selecting a specific language, you’ve also enabled your ads to appear to those who speak that language, whether they are in the selected country or not.</p>
<p>These small updates to your feed can significantly improve the discoverability of your product listings.</p>
<h2>How to opt-out products from Shopping ads in individual countries</h2>
<p>You also have the freedom and ability to exclude some products from certain countries. Simply use the shopping_ads_excluded_country attribute when setting up your catalog through Google Merchant Center to pick and choose which countries you don’t want your shopping ads to appear in.</p>
<h3>Google Merchant Center: Common Errors for Multi-Country Feeds</h3>
<p>To prevent product listing disapprovals, Google Merchant Center will automatically analyze your product data and notify you if any key issues or errors arise.</p>
<p>Here are a few of these common errors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Missing ID in the feed catalog</strong></li>
<li><strong>Currency and country mismatch</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stock &amp; availability errors</strong></li>
<li><strong>Shipping information &amp; tax information issues</strong></li>
<li><strong>Errors with product images</strong></li>
<li><strong>Errors with product descriptions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Although these common errors can cause some setbacks, the great thing about Google Merchant Centre is that errors are flagged, and you will be notified automatically.</p>
<p>On top of that, by partnering with a sophisticated feed management solution, you’ll have access to several benefits that make these common errors feel like a bump in the road.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Using A Feed Management Platform for Google Shopping</h2>
<p>Having your product feeds optimized for international markets through Google Merchant Center means that your customers in other countries will see your products listed in their native language and currency.</p>
<p>By offering that kind of tailored shopping experience to your customers, you’ve already got an advantage over your competition.</p>
<p>A solution that includes <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://highstreet.io/platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feed management software</a></span> and a managed service to properly categorize your products based on the intended country and language helps you sell more products around the globe.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2>Facebook &amp; Instagram: Feeds for Multiple Countries &amp; Currencies</h2>
<p><a href="https://highstreet.io/?attachment_id=9492"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-9492 size-large" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Instagram-Facebook-Multicountry-Feed-1024x256.jpg" alt="instagram-multicountry-feed" width="1024" height="256" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Instagram-Facebook-Multicountry-Feed-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Instagram-Facebook-Multicountry-Feed-980x245.jpg 980w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Instagram-Facebook-Multicountry-Feed-480x120.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p>There are three different types of feeds you need to set up on Facebook and Instagram to successfully advertise and sell your products in international markets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Catalog feed (which serves as the primary feed)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Language feed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Currency feed</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>With the help of a leading tech partner, like <a href="https://highstreet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Highstreet.io</span></a>, all three of these feeds can be consolidated into a single master feed, for optimal performance.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Steps to Set up Your Multi-Country and Multi-Language Feeds</h3>
<p>As a merchant, there are two steps to successfully set -up your Multi-Country and Multi-Language feeds to maximize your performance on Facebook and Instagram:</p>
<p><strong>STEP 1: Create a catalog feed for a default country and language</strong></p>
<p>When it comes time to develop accurate <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://highstreet.io/instagram-product-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product feeds for Instagram</a></span> and Facebook, you’ll want to start by selecting your desired countries and languages. Start by creating a catalog for your default language and country. Then, you’ll want to upload a data feed containing all of your product data to a catalog feed.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Your products must be present in all countries you&#8217;ve selected, but if this is not the case, the catalog file must be the one associated with the country with the highest number of products.</p>
<p>To help get you started, you can download a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2144286692311411?id=725943027795860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">country-specific feed template</a></span> from your Commerce Manager tab through your Facebook Business Help Center.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2: Upload your data with the correct information and attributes</strong></p>
<p>Once you have your country and language feeds determined and selected, you’ll need to upload these feeds to your catalog (primary) feed, while making sure that you’re providing the correct information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Country-specific pricing</li>
<li>Product descriptions</li>
<li>Language Code</li>
<li>Country Code</li>
<li>Stock availability</li>
<li>URLs by country (location)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Facebook &amp; Instagram Ads: Common Multi-Country Feed Errors</h3>
<p>Below is a list of some common errors that can lead to product disapprovals on Facebook and Instagram. While many of these are similar to the common errors of Google Merchant Center, it’s important to understand how to effectively resolve these errors to avoid any major setbacks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inaccurate pricing data<br /></strong>When implementing pricing data, be sure to include a 3-digit ISO 4217 currency code, such as EUR, rather than a currency symbol, such as €. If your price includes a decimal point, use a period (.) as the decimal, not a comma (,).Here’s a good example of the correct usage:<br />Correct: 5.99 EUR<br />Incorrect: 5,99 €</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Missing ID in the feed catalog<br /></strong>Entering a product that is not in the catalog feed will result in an error. If a product doesn&#8217;t have a translation for a particular language, or if it’s unavailable in a particular country, then it can be omitted from the language or country feeds respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Alternatively, if a product is missing in the Catalog feed, it means it can&#8217;t be present anywhere else, and Facebook throws an error if you try to upload a translation for a product that is not present in the Catalog feed.</p>
<p>Some other common issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Currency and country mismatch</strong></li>
<li><strong>Shipping information &amp; tax information issues</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stock &amp; availability errors</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily, with the help of a versatile feed management partner, these potential issues can be handled with ease, freeing up your time so that you can focus on effectively selling your products.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Using a Feed Management Platform for Facebook &amp; Instagram Ads</h2>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Ecommerce marketing channels are constantly evolving, which means that your product feeds need to be highly responsive and accurate to adhere to the ever-changing standards of different channels.<br />Without proper validation, optimization, and compliance, you run the risk of having unresolved issues and inaccurate product listings that will ultimately hinder your store’s overall performance and a bad reputation among customers that will ultimately choose your competitors instead of you.</p>
<p>Partnering with a knowledgeable technical partner will provide you with the accuracy and efficiency you are looking for, so your product feeds are compliant and optimized for each platform.<br />Let&#8217;s take a look at how eCommerce Channels stay compliant and get all the tips for enhanced product feeds optimized for success.</p>
<h2>How Different eCommerce Channels use Compliant &amp; Optimized Product Feeds</h2>
<p>Finding a robust platform that streamlines the optimization and compliance process of your product feeds for different channels is a game-changer. Here&#8217;s why optimized product feeds are so important for you to be compliant with all channels requirement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shopping Ads &amp; Remarketing Ads<br /></strong>When it comes to either shopping ads or remarketing ads, optimized product feeds allow your products to be properly targeted, improving your reach and visibility.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution &amp; Retail Channels<br /></strong>With distribution and retail channels, product feed compliance and optimization means they can quickly update your product listings and start selling new products due to the submission of accurate product information that is ready to market.</li>
<li><strong>Marketplaces<br /></strong>In different marketplaces, producing optimized feeds means always having up-to-date product information without compromise.</li>
<li><strong>eCommerce Solutions<br /></strong>Optimized product feeds are beneficial with other third-party tools for eCommerce, such as built-in site search systems, rate and review systems, and even improving your store’s checkout flow with shopping cart abandonment services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Manually fetching rich data can be extremely time-consuming. Retailers, distributors, marketplaces, and other eCommerce tools require optimized feeds for the best performance.<br />The <a href="https://highstreet.io/platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Highstreet.io platform</a> gives you the tools to support compliance and optimization efforts, as well as troubleshooting capabilities so you can eliminate the need to manually fix and troubleshoot various issues.</p>
<h2>Google Merchant Center Feed: Optimization Techniques &amp; Compliance Rules</h2>
<p>Dealing with compliance issues can be a full-time job if you don’t know all of the requirements Google has for both your website and your product feeds.  Moreover, Google Merchant Center has strict requirements for product data feeds, making your job a lot more challenging when it comes to submitting accurate data. They require specific data attributes that help identify the unique characteristics of your products and leave little-to-no room for error or inaccuracies with this data.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://highstreet.io/product-feed-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud-based feed management tool</a> helps resolve errors that will ultimately lead to disapproved products. On top of that, Highstreet. io-specific integration with Google Merchant Diagnostics API helps you address issues by automatically alerting customers when major issues are found.</p>
<h3>Google Merchant Center Feed Compliance</h3>
<p>Understanding the rules for each of your product listing channels is essential to preventing disapproved products. This is especially relevant to platforms like Google Merchant Center.</p>
<p>Lesser-known GMC errors that may prevent you from advertising on Google Shopping:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inappropriate Language<br /></strong>If your product feed mixes languages, then Google Merchant Center will likely flag your feed, which can ultimately lead to account suspension. Avoid mixing languages to avoid the headache altogether.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Checkout Requirements<br /></strong>A bad user experience, specifically at checkout, can not only run the risk of becoming a deterrent for the end-user but will subsequently be flagged by Google Merchant Center as having a poor UX, and therefore will neglect running your ads.</li>
<li><strong>Google Bots<br /></strong>When crawling your webpage, if a bot discovers any sort of error, be it robots.txt, 404, slow renderings/high latency, or any navigational hiccups within your sitemap – Google Merchant Center can and will disapprove your ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>More popular GMC compliance errors that are easier to fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalid value [availability] /or/ Missing required attribute: [availability]</li>
<li>Missing shipping information</li>
<li>Limited performance due to missing identifiers [gtin, mpn, brand]</li>
<li>Invalid value for category [price]</li>
<li>Missing value [description] /or/ Text too short</li>
<li>Image too small /or/ Low image quality [image link]</li>
</ul>
<p>When these errors occur, you run the risk of disapproved products across multiple channels. With a centralized tool at work, these errors and disapproved products are immediately and automatically addressed behind the scenes, avoiding further issues with your product feeds so you can continue selling your products online with ease.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3>Google Merchant Center Feed Optimization</h3>
<p>Once your campaigns are compliant then it’s time to optimize your product data in a way that will get the most interest from users.</p>
<p>Lesser-known techniques you may want to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product Highlights<br /></strong>This recent feature is based on short bulleted lists to present the most relevant features of the seller&#8217;s products. Follow the rules for max size and max number of bullet points.</li>
<li><strong>Use Unit Pricing when appropriate<br /></strong>It may be useful to define the measurements and dimensions of a product to allow users to understand the exact cost per unit of a product.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize for Smart Campaigns:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">&#8211; Choose landscape images<br />&#8211; Use videos<br />&#8211; Use headlines<br />&#8211; Description text is very important</p>
<p>More popular techniques that should be part of your basic GMC optimization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitor the Number of Shopping Offers<br /></strong>The objective is to monitor the number of shopping offers at different stages.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">&#8211; submitted offers<br />&#8211; suspended offers because of a suspended account<br />&#8211; pending offers (review state)<br />&#8211; disapproved offers<br />&#8211; out-of-stock offers<br />&#8211; targeted offers because on a shopping campaign<br />&#8211; offers with impressions<br />&#8211; offers with clicks</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitor Duplicate Titles<br /></strong>Unique titles help consumers identify the product before they click. Duplicate titles indicate that titles are not descriptive enough or are missing important variant attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Product Descriptions are Complete<br /></strong>Make sure they have enough content and are unique. Incomplete descriptions may have an effect on product keywords that Google Merchant Center extracts from feeds.</li>
</ul>
