										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Amazon’s ever-expanding global network encompassing over 175 fulfillment centers, the capabilities and advantages of its Fulfilled By Amazon (FBA) platform continue to grow.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean Amazon FBA is right for every brand, or in all circumstances. As you expand your eCommerce capabilities, the Amazon FBA vs. FBM debate can become difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>This post will help by walking you through the details of both options, along with some tips on inventory management and additional automation opportunities you should consider.</p>
<h2>What is Amazon FBA Inventory Management?</h2>
<p>Amazon FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) Inventory Management is a system that allows your business to <b>organize, track, and optimize your store product inventory in their fulfillment centers</b>.</p>
<p>The platform handles critical inventory and order management tasks like:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li>monitoring stock levels</li>
<li>forecasting product demand</li>
<li>replenishing inventory</li>
<li>fulfilling orders</li>
<li>handling returns</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Amazon FBA Inventory Management Works</h2>
<p>When a customer places an order, Amazon handles the picking, packing, shipping, and customer service, providing sellers with a streamlined and efficient way to fulfill orders and reach a broader customer base.</p>
<h3>Amazon FBA Setup Steps:</h3>
<p>Setting up an Amazon FBA account is the first step to leveraging the platform’s fulfillment capabilities. Follow these simple steps and benefit from streamlined order fulfillment, access to Prime customers, and the means for providing excellent customer service.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: FBA Setup </strong></h3>
<p>Create your Amazon selling account and log in to Seller Central to set up FBA.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2: List Your Products </strong></h3>
<p>Add your products to the Amazon catalog and indicate them as FBA inventory.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Product Preparation </strong></h3>
<p>Follow Amazon’s packing guidelines and shipping requirements to ensure your products are prepared safely and securely for transportation to a fulfillment center.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Send to Amazon </strong></h3>
<p>Create a shipping plan, print Amazon shipment ID labels, and send your shipments to designated Amazon fulfillment centers.</p>
<h2>What is Amazon FBM?</h2>
<p>Amazon FBA isn’t the only way to manage the process of getting online orders shipped to consumers. <i>The</i> company also offers Amazon Fulfillment by Merchant (FBM), where sellers either manages or works with a third party to handle areas such as inventory placement, storage, shipping, processing returns and customer service issues.</p>
<h2>Key Differences Between Amazon FBA and FBM</h2>
<p>Evaluating Amazon FBA vs. FBM requires thinking across a range of business factors, some of which will be more important than others depending on the size of your company, typical order volumes and your strategic goals.</p>
<h3>Startup Costs and Fees</h3>
<p>Be prepared for a wide range of fees when you get started with Amazon FBA. These not only include per-unit fees but monthly charges for storing inventory, return fees for some product categories, package prep fees and more. In contrast, Amazon FBM only involves paying an annual subscription fee.</p>
<p>On the flip side, fulfilling your own orders means you’ll have to have your own warehouse (or work with a partner with more cost-effective services than Amazon’s) and other in-house resources for picking, packing and shipping your products.</p>
<h3>Control Over Shipping and Customer Interaction</h3>
<p>Amazon FBA is akin to many traditional outsourcing services, which free up the companies that use them to concentrate on areas like developing better products, marketing and nurturing customer relationships.</p>
<p>In some cases, though, staying close to customer needs and expectations can become harder when you fulfill orders through intermediaries, which is where Amazon FBM might be the better approach. Amazon FBM also means you’re not affected by sudden changes in fulfillment policies and support options that Amazon makes occasionally.</p>
<h3>Inventory Management and Logistics</h3>
<p>Unless you already have a background or experience in order fulfillment, option for Amazon FBM will require extensive learning and development across your company. This isn’t as big of an issue for companies when they first launch, but the complexity can increase as your volume of orders goes up. Of course, handing off everything through Amazon FBA means you’ll never master these areas, either.</p>
<h3>Scalability and Growth Potential</h3>
<p>Most brands want to continually add more customers, increase revenue and expand into international markets. Taking the Amazon FBA approach allows you to scale and grow without worrying about the impact on order fulfillment. If you decide to go the Amazon FBM route instead, you’ll just have to develop a business plan that takes into account the potential need for more warehouses, staff and other resources.</p>
<h2>Pros and Cons of Amazon FBA</h2>
<p>There’s a lot to be said for using Amazon FBA, but also a few tradeoffs:</p>
<h3>Pro: Stress-free shipping</h3>
<p>The process of picking, packing and transporting products from a warehouse to a customer’s doorstep can be highly complex, time-consuming and expense. Amazon FBA provides an option to completely outsource this area so brands can focus their attention entirely on marketing, selling and developing their products.</p>
<h3>Con: Higher expenses</h3>
<p>Selling your own products can require significant capital expense. Using Amazon FBA means you’ll be responsible for a range of storage and fulfillment fees, as well as the costs of sitting on inventory if sales don’t reach expected levels.</p>
<h3>Pro: Prime shipping</h3>
<p>There’s a reason Amazon has managed to develop one of the most popular loyalty programs of all time. Free shipping for Prime members can make all the difference with customers who aren’t sure whether to go through with a purchase. Using Amazon FBA means your products can offer Prime shipping too, offering an immediate competitive advantage over brands that aren’t.</p>
<h3>Con: Policy compliance</h3>
<p>Selling with Amazon FBA means agreeing you’ll adhere to all its guidelines. These include the way products are added to its database, packaging and other specifications. It can take time to learn Amazon FBA policies and ensure you’re maintaining compliance on an ongoing basis.</p>
<h3>Pro: Post-purchase journey management</h3>
<p>Customers will remember (and reward) brands that help them with customer service issues and process returns without a hassle. Brands that use Amazon FBA effectively outsource their customer service operation, and the company has a proven track record in bringing efficiency to product returns.</p>
<h3>Con: Inventory fluctuations</h3>
<p>The flip side of Amazon’s best-in-class returns process is that customers may send more of your products back than expected, in some cases buying multiple versions or styles to try them first. Having Amazon serve as a fulfillment partner can also make it difficult to maintain full visibility into what you have in stock.</p>
<h2>Pros and Cons of Amazon FBM</h2>
<p>Similarly, companies thinking about Amazon FBM should weigh the following risks and rewards:</p>
<h3>Pro: Increased profit</h3>
<p>If you’re a brand selling high-value products (like luxury fashion and accessories) with relatively low order volumes, using Amazon FBM could potentially mean a wider profit margin than outsourcing your fulfillment processes.</p>
<h3>Con: Greater resource investment</h3>
<p>Even a profitable company will have to ensure they offset the absence of Amazon resources to help manage order fulfillment, returns and related tasks. The amount of warehouse space you’ll need to store products can also vary widely during periods like the holiday season, which makes planning how much time, effort and equipment you’ll be investing in these areas even more difficult.</p>
<h3>Pro: Flexibility for personalized experiences</h3>
<p>When you choose Amazon FBM you retain full control over how your products are packaged, which could allow you to personalize orders for your most valuable customers. You’ll also be able to make judgment calls on whether to waive fees or other policies when a loyal customer needs to process a return.</p>
<h3>Con: The lack of Prime status</h3>
<p>In most cases products fulfilled via Amazon FBM are not eligible for Prime. This cuts your brand out from a large number of established Amazon customers who regularly make purchases in order to justify their monthly membership fees.</p>
<h3>Pro: More opportunities to gather and analyze data</h3>
<p>Managing fulfillment on your own could help deepen insights in customer shopping patterns, distribution channel preferences and more. This opens the door to creating customer segments and a more tailored approach to marketing and selling your products.</p>
<h3>Con: Greater risk of negative outcomes</h3>
<p>If orders arrive slowly, late or the wrong product is delivered, you’ll only have your own fulfillment operation to blame. However those mistakes can add up, having an adverse affect on areas such as customer retention and customer lifetime value.</p>
<h2>How the Amazon FBA vs. FBM Decision Can Affect Your Multichannel eCommerce</h2>
<p>Many brands are not only selling their products on their own websites and online marketplaces like Amazon but via additional eCommerce channels. These channels can be highly proprietary and a lack of integration can cause problems in taking and fulfilling orders. If your company has reached this level of complexity, Amazon FBA might be the desired option due to factors such as:</p>
<h3>Managing Inventory Across Multiple Channels</h3>
<p>Amazon FBA includes Multi Channel Fulfillment (MCF) services, whereby sellers can use API plug-ins to connect popular eCommerce channels such as WooCommerce and Magento. Amazon also offers multi-channel listing software so you can making listings from a single location.</p>
<p>If you go with Amazon FBM, you’ll have to address this on your own or with a trusted third party with experience in multichannel eCommerce integration and product listing.</p>
<h3>Ensuring Fast Shipping and Quality Control</h3>
<p>Regardless of the Amazon FBA vs. FBM question, all customers will want the same thing: to have the right product arrive in a timely manner without any damage or other quality control issues.</p>
<p>Beyond speed of order fulfillment, some of the most common quality control problems stem from a lack of poor inventory management. Here’s how to address them:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li><b>Stockouts:</b> Inadequate inventory management can sometimes lead to frequent stockouts, where your products become unavailable for purchase. This results in missed sales opportunities, dissatisfied customers, and potential damage to your seller’s reputation.&gt; <a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/sell/pdf/FBA-Restock-Guide-EN.pdf?initialSessionID=143-2708112-8182239&amp;ld=NSGoogle&amp;ldStackingCodes=NSGoogle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon’s re-stock guide</a> helps to keep your stock up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li><b>Overstocking</b>: Poor inventory management may lead to overstocking, where you hold excessive inventory that ties up capital and storage space. Overstocking can increase storage fees, inventory obsolescence, and reduce profitability.&gt;The <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon?ref_=sdus_soa_sov_invent_myi#inventory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Excess Inventory page</a> in your Seller Central FBA account helps you maintain the right inventory levels.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li><b>Inaccurate Order Fulfillment:</b> Fulfilling customer orders is only possible with accurate inventory management. You could mistakenly accept orders for products that are no longer in stock, leading to cancellations, negative reviews, and customer dissatisfaction.&gt;<a href="https://sell.amazon.com/learn/inventory-management#inventory-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon’s Inventory Management Dashboard</a> is an excellent way to track your orders and inventory.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li><b>Inefficient Replenishment:</b> The inability to accurately forecast customer demand and manage inventory numbers can result in inadequate replenishment. Sellers may experience delays in restocking.&gt;Use a tool like <a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/sell/pdf/FBA-Restock-Guide-EN.pdf?initialSessionID=143-2708112-8182239&amp;ld=NSGoogle&amp;ldStackingCodes=NSGoogle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon’s re-stock guide</a> to avoid these holdups.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Expanding your eCommerce sales beyond your brand’s own web site is a big decision. Online marketplaces represent a huge opportunity to reach a much larger addressable market and grow revenues, but it’s important to choose carefully.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://Suvae.org/selling-on-luxury-fashion-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">luxury fashion retailers</a>, for instance, the best way to ensure near-term return on investment (ROI) is to identify online marketplaces that:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li>Specialize in clothing, footwear and accessories, where consumers are actively browsing for products like yours.</li>
<li>Has established a proven track record in driving traffic and engagement with consumers</li>
<li>Offers partnership programs with reasonable terms and enticing seller benefits.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Asos and Zalando: Two specialists in online fashion sales</h2>
<p>Asos and Zalando are perfect examples of digital destinations that meet these criteria. Both have attracted a considerable number of sellers and  have successfully expanded their portfolios in order to satisfy consumer demand.</p>
<p>While it’s possible to integrate with multiple marketplaces simultaneously, many eCommerce strategies involve starting with one. That way you can test the waters in terms of how you promote products on a third-party marketplace and adapt to any rules that have been put in place.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here’s a rundown Asos vs Zalando and how they compare from an online  marketplace perspective:</p>
<h2>Why choose Asos marketplace</h2>
<p>For nearly 25 years, the name “Asos” has become almost synonymous with fast fashion, particularly among younger online shoppers. The company’s success with its own affordable but stylish apparel and accessories has led to several strategic acquisitions, such as Topshop.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Asos marketplace has allowed the brand to significantly expand the selection of products it offers. This not only includes new products but vintage collections, which can be appealing to those focused on sustainability through reuse.</p>
<p>These are the Asos marketplace numbers you need to know:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li>Market share:<a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/54275-95#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 45% of Asos’s sales come from its home market in the U.K.</a>, followed by 30% of other European countries. It also has significant sales from the U.S.</li>
<li>Average customer: More than<a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/asos.com/#demographics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 33% of Asos visitors are between the ages of 25 and 24</a>.</li>
<li>Brand scope: Asos manages 13 of its own brands and offers more than 900 others through the Asos marketplace.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why choose Zalando marketplace</h2>
<p>Selling shoes online was just the first step for the Zalando marketplace. Today the company is a viable online shopping destination for everything from evening gowns to handbags. It is also broadening the scope of its business model, investing in products and capabilities to support business-to-business (B2B) as well as its traditional consumer audience. Its more recent innovations include<a href="https://corporate.zalando.com/en/technology/zalando-launches-size-recommendations-based-customers-own-body-measurements" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a digital tool to predict sizing</a> based on photos submitted by its customers.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Zalando stacks up by the numbers:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li><b>Market share</b>: Zalando commands about<a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/53796-70#:~:text=Zalando%20General%20Information&amp;text=The%20company%20commands%20around%2012,the%20firm%20has%20a%20presence)." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 12% of Europe’s overall sales for apparel products</a>.</li>
<li><b>Average customer</b>: More than <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/zalando.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27% of Zalando’s visitors fall between the ages of 25-34</a>.</li>
<li><b>Brand scope</b>: More than 7,000 brands are available in the Zalando marketplace</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these basic figures, it’s important to consider the policies online marketplace operators have in place to support sellers. Asos doesn’t charge a commission to list products, for instance, and you’re able to upload your entire catalog. Zalando, meanwhile, offers marketing services to help brands advertise on its marketplace as well as a distribution and fulfillment arm.</p>
<h2>Asos vs Zalando: The bottom line</h2>
<p>In the end, both the Asos marketplace and the Zalando marketplace create opportunities for growing brands to find new customers and increase their revenues. Getting started with either, however, depends on effectively managing your product feeds.</p>
<p>Once approved in each company’s partner program, you’ll need to be able to seamlessly transfer data from your product catalogs directly to either marketplace. As you make changes to pricing, product content or introduce new promotions, your feeds will need to remain accurate and up to date. That’s why Suvae.org offers marketplace integrations for <a href="https://Suvae.org/asos-integration/">Asos</a>, <a href="https://Suvae.org/zalando-integration/">Zalando </a>and dozens of others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The definition of luxury changes when you move from the physical world to online shopping.</p>
<p>Consumers who go looking for luxury fashion in person can appreciate a well-designed space devoted exclusively to a single brand.</p>
<p>They might admire the tasteful décor that sets off the clothes to even greater effect.</p>
<p>An in-person luxury shopping experience also tends to be highly curated – in other words, retailers might only need to showcase their finest goods in order to appeal to discerning customers.</p>
<h2>Why you should sell through a luxury fashion marketplace</h2>
<p>The potential to grow revenues through digital channels requires luxury brands to rethink all of these principals and focus on an entirely different kind of experience.</p>
<p>The key priorities for eCommerce shoppers, including those focused on luxury fashion – are speed, convenience and accurate information.</p>
<p>Consumers expect to find the luxury brands they want instantly. They want as many options as possible in order to make the best choice. And when they’re considering a particular item, they need to feel confident that all the details – especially availability – is up to date.</p>
<p>This helps explain why elite brands are increasingly expanding their digital presence beyond their own web sites and featuring their products through luxury fashion marketplaces.</p>
<p>Far from losing any perception of prestige, adding products to a luxury fashion marketplace shows a brand recognizes that true luxury in eCommerce is all about making it easy to get what you want.</p>
<p>That said, luxury brands should still put the same care and attention into their presence within online marketplaces as they do setting up a physical location.</p>
<p>With the right approach to optimization, your brand will be:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li>Discovered by more consumers</li>
<li>Driving more conversions and revenue</li>
<li>Encourage repeat visits and positive word of mouth</li>
</ul>
<h2>Optimizing eCommerce for a luxury fashion marketplace</h2>
<p>The Internet is already a busy place, where it can be difficult for particular brands to stand out. A lot of the business you drive through your own website will depend on traffic you get through search engine optimization (SEO) and paid marketing tactics.</p>
<p>Joining a luxury fashion marketplace brings you into a more focused environment where consumers are looking for a wide range of brands to explore. However this also means you’ll want to differentiate yourself from other retailers selling within the same space.</p>
<h2>How luxury brands can stand out in an online marketplace</h2>
<p>If you operate physical stores, you probably thought carefully about how they were built and ensured they were easy to stroll through without getting lost. The same principle applies online.</p>
<h3>Introduce yourself (and reinforce your brand identity)</h3>
<p>Your logo is only one element that tells consumers who you are and why you represent a brand worth exploring.</p>
<p>Remember that some of those browsing a luxury marketplace may not be familiar with you at all. Make the best possible impression by including information such as a condensed version of your mission and any relevant details about your history and reputation.</p>
<p>Others may come on a luxury fashion marketplace hoping to find your brand included, and these details will reassure them the experience you’re offering will be consistent with what they’ve seen elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Let each product description tell a compelling story</h3>
<p>Offering basic details such as sizes, colors and pricing are just a starting point when you’re positioning your products through a luxury clothing marketplace.</p>
<p>Converting browsers into buyers is all about making them understand your brand’s unique approach to developing quality apparel and accessories. This can include the materials you use, the craftsmanship you apply and more.</p>
<p>The copywriting you do here can make the difference between attracting a customer who stays with you for life and one who chooses to browse another brand instead.</p>
<h3>Ensure every image offers maximum appeal</h3>
<p>You don’t always need ideal lighting when you’re selling products in a physical store because shoppers can touch and feel them directly. In a luxury clothing marketplace, pictures represent the most powerful way for you to convey the beauty and style of every item.</p>
<p>Choose images that not only provide a clear view of what you’re selling but create a sense of aspiration. This can mean showing products from different angles and incorporating lifestyle elements, such as a model wearing a product in an attractive everyday setting.</p>
<h3>Use data analytics to inform the most meaningful changes</h3>
<p>Retailers always keep a close eye on the number of products they sell, but being on a luxury marketplace can offer other data points that can help you continuously improve how you showcase your products.</p>
<p>Look for ways to measure the time spent on each product, shopping cart abandonment rates and anything specific provided by a marketplace operator to fine-tune your approach. The more data-driven you can be as a retailer, the more likely you’ll be able to reach or even exceed your eCommerce goals.</p>
<h2>The best luxury fashion marketplace options for premium brands</h2>
<p>Your sales strategy for luxury marketplaces can begin by identifying which platforms align best with your ideal customer profile and brand. In doing so you’ll also want to take into account the level of active users each platform offers, seller requirements and the options for handling shipping and returns.</p>
<p>Some brands start by integrating with a single luxury marketplace and taking a “test and learn” approach before adding others. Once you’ve learned what’s involved in getting set up – and when you have partners with the technologies to help automate the process – it can be easier to expand into other luxury clothing marketplaces over time.</p>
<p>Some of the most common platforms where other luxury brands are actively selling right now include:</p>
<h3>Zalando</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-18546" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Secrets-of-selling-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" /></p>
<p>It’s already one of Europe’s most popular online destinations for luxury fashion, but<a href="https://Suvae.org/zalando-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Zalando</a> is continuing to make changes that could strengthen its market position even further.</p>
<p>In early 2024, for example,<a href="https://internetretailing.net/zalando-targets-both-b2c-and-b2b-in-growth-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Zalando announced it is working to enrich some of its existing categories</a>, including Sports and Kids &amp; Family through technologies that will personalize the inspiration it provides. Tools like Zalando Assistant, meanwhile, is allowing commerce to become more conversational – almost akin to the expert help luxury brands have traditionally provided in-store through expert associates.</p>
<p><a href="https://fashionunited.uk/news/business/zalando-targets-a-larger-share-of-the-fashion-e-commerce-market-with-new-ecosystem/2024031374584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zalando has also said it is opening up its logistics infrastructure, software and service capabilities</a> to help retailers sell more effectively to customers.</p>
<h3>Asos</h3>
<p>Luxury clothing isn’t limited to new merchandise. Many shoppers go online looking for vintage collections and the latest collections at the same time. Asos has a marketplace that has been successful in both kinds of clothing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1252308/asos-marketplace-second-hand-apparel-online-shops-brand-profile-in-the-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brand awareness for the Asos marketplace is 65% in the U.K. alone</a>, and 80% of its customers tend to be loyal to the brand. That could mean a lot of return visits for luxury brands who feature products on the Asos marketplace.</p>
<p>In the meantime,<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/uks-asos-sinks-first-half-loss-names-dave-murray-cfo-2024-04-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Asos in early 2024 appointed a new CFO</a> whose eCommerce experience includes a stint at Amazon, suggesting Asos will become even more competitive in the fashion sector.</p>
<h3>Farfetch</h3>
<p>From the moment it launched in 2007,<a href="https://Suvae.org/integrazione-marketplace-farfetch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Farfetch</a> has been focused on acting as a trusted partner to brands that want to be included on the top global luxury fashion marketplace.</p>
<p>This means Farfetch doesn’t carry any inventory of its own but provides third-party services to help other luxury brands find sales success.</p>
<p>In early 2024,<a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2023/12/18/coupang-to-acquire-farfetch-assets-in-500-million-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Farfetch was acquired by South Korean eCommerce giant Coupang</a>, which said it would invest in helping the marketplace to further improve the customer experience for luxury shoppers around the world.</p>
<h2>Bet on the most sought-after luxury brands and increase sales</h2>
<p>The best sales strategy for luxury marketplaces always takes into account what other premium brands are doing online. Even as you begin uploading your products to the kinds of platforms we’ve just described, you should continue to monitor and assess competitors whose activities could provide insight on eCommerce best practices as they emerge.</p>
<p>Some of the parameters to keep in mind here:</p>
<h3>The most searched luxury brands online</h3>
<p><a href="https://us.fashionnetwork.com/news/Louis-vuitton-gucci-most-searched-for-luxury-brands-in-2023-according-to-google-data,1570517.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Dior are the “big three”</a> in terms of what consumers are keying into Google, according to recent data. Pay attention to the keywords these brands are using to rank in search results, and how you might weave them into your own copy.</p>
<h3>The most profitable luxury brands online</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/5-most-valuable-luxury-companies-in-the-world-1261298/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LVMH scores the top spot in this category as well</a>, followed by luxury brands such as Dior, Hermes and EssilorLuxottica, among others. While profitability is driven from many different facets, these brands represent the ideal in how they balance supply and demand as they serve style-conscious consumers</p>
<h3>The most in-demand luxury fashion brands online</h3>
<p>It may be a subjective area, but shopping app <a href="https://fashionista.com/2024/01/lyst-index-top-popular-brands-products-2023-q4-prada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyst’s most recent quarterly index</a> said Prada is the hottest luxury brand, followed by Miu Miu, Loewe and Bottega Veneta. Use this kind of ranking to consider the most creative approaches luxury brands can take in how they market themselves online as you prepare your product listings and images to upload onto online marketplaces.</p>
<h2>The most important luxury fashion marketplace best practice of all</h2>
<p>Luxury brands have to be good at many different things at once: designing products, creating compelling marketing content and providing outstanding customer service.</p>
<p>That means they shouldn’t be bogged down with the technical aspects of getting their products on a luxury clothing marketplace. Automating this process through a product feed management solution is the smartest move you can make as you prepare to boost your long-term eCommerce sales.<a href="https://Suvae.org/contact-us/"> Connect with us</a> to find out how we can assist with integration across more than 50 of the top marketplaces in the world.</p>

<p>Years ago, one sure sign of a brand’s success was its products being featured on the shelves of an ever-growing number of retailers and department stores. Today, success is about finding a brand while browsing the online marketplace of your choice – and trusting that you can order the products you need based on active inventory data without having to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Brands understand this, but expanding through digital channels presents a different set of challenges than setting up physical locations or adding more retail and wholesale partners.</p>
<p>First, there is no shortage of online marketplaces to choose from. Besides familiar names like Amazon or Zalando, retailers ranging from <a href="https://Suvae.org/unlock-the-potential-of-macys-marketplace-with-integration-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macy&#8217;s and Bloomingdales</a> to Belk and <a href="https://Suvae.org/online-marketplaces-usa-expand-ecommerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others </a>are all actively working with third-party sellers. More than likely, growing brands will want to be present across many marketplaces at once to achieve their eCommerce revenue targets.</p>

<h2>Why inventory data is critical to online marketplace success</h2>
<p>Ensuring a great customer experience across multiple channels relies on sending the correct stock data to each marketplace, enabling consumers to see what&#8217;s available for purchase. Accurate pricing and inventory information are just as crucial as presenting product features and an appealing image.</p>
<p>This is why many brands seek out <a href="https://Suvae.org/multi-marketplace-integration-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketplace integration services</a> in the first place, though their needs could evolve significantly as they continue to expand.</p>
<p>Initially, a brand might update product feeds from a central warehouse hourly during the day and every few hours at night, depending on its location. Concurrently, historical sales data could determine the percentage of stock to distribute to each marketplace.</p>
<p>In practice, sales can unexpectedly fluctuate based on shifts in demand from one online marketplace to another. The existing cadence of product feed updates may not keep pace with purchases, increasing order cancellations. This not only impacts customer experience but also jeopardizes relationships with online marketplaces that base seller agreements on minimizing cancellation rates.</p>
<h2>Innovation that addresses active inventory management</h2>
<p>Suvae.org recently developed a real-time system to address these challenges. It allows brands to <b>dynamically manage active inventory across multiple marketplaces at once</b>. This involved changing the architecture of our existing solutions to adjust the way data is handled once a product had been ordered, but not yet fulfilled.</p>
<p>The functionality Suvae.org built introduces a series of dedicated “buckets” that <b>manage inventory data in both physical and virtual warehouses</b>, as well as a component that can calculate how inventory should be distributed based upon pre-defined business rules. Incremental orders could be “reserved” as they are created, for example, but the system also tracks when they were canceled or when the system needs to be reset.</p>
<p>Brands also need to store inventory values once orders have been distributed, of course, and Suvae.org’s active inventory solution added that too. It also includes a module to configure the flow of inventory data across channels and a way to visualize a brand’s inventory by marketplace and SKU, as well as the history of all updates from a brand’s product feeds.</p>
<h2>The benefits of enhancing your ability to manage active inventory</h2>
<h3>1. Reduce your cancellation rate</h3>
<p>Suvae.org’s active inventory solution will provide brands greater confidence that their customers will be able to find the products they want, regardless of the online marketplaces where they choose to shop. This also helps build a <b>track record for increased accuracy</b>, which allows brands to meet the key performance indicators of their marketplace partners.</p>
<h3>2. Complete automation of a complex process</h3>
<p>By calculating the precise stock value that gets sent to each marketplace, Suvae.org’s active inventory solution will also save brands from having to conduct a manual, historical analysis of which orders were canceled or the rate of cancellation.</p>
<h3>3. Gain insight into sales performance across multiple online marketplaces</h3>
<p>While the technology handles the heavy lifting, brands need to maintain clear visibility into the health of their business at all times. That’s why <strong>Suvae.org&#8217;s active inventory solution</strong> also provides reporting on the state of its inventory, orders, and SKUs. These reports are emailed to simplify distribution to all relevant stakeholders, empowering them to make informed decisions about the evolution of their sales and marketing strategy.</p>
<h3>4. Ease of expansion to into additional online marketplaces</h3>
<p>With more third parties opening up platforms for sellers, it will not be unusual for brands to make their products available across a wide range of partners. They will now be in a better position to do so, knowing thanks to the ability to <b>dynamically synchronize pricing and inventory data across all shopping channels.</b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When your business is primarily focused on physical stores, you might have locations with top addresses such as “New York, NY” or “Miami, Fla.” As more brands discover the critical importance of eCommerce as a sales channel, however, the most viable location might simply be “online marketplace, USA.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/us-retail-ecommerce-marketplaces-forecast-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data collected by eMarketer</a>, for example, USA marketplaces will grow by more than 10% in 2023 to nearly $385 billion. This represents more than a third of total retail eCommerce sales. That trend is expected to continue over the next five years when the rate of U.S. marketplace growth will surpass 12%.</p>
<p>Expanding sales into online marketplaces in the USA can help you reach a broader audience, increase product visibility, and significantly improve your sales.</p>
<p>While many brands are already familiar with the biggest USA marketplace players, it pays to do your research. Depending on how you set up your products and promote them, there’s a whole world of untapped potential to reach consumers who might never have discovered your brand otherwise.</p>
<h2>Online Marketplaces in the USA: The Top Choices</h2>
<p>The growth of online marketplaces in the USA continues unabated, accompanied by increasing competition. The oversaturation of retailers within these marketplaces presents formidable barriers to overcome.<br />
That&#8217;s why many retailers and distributors have taken matters into their own hands by establishing their own USA marketplaces. This initiative has enabled them to reduce shipping costs, streamline product assortment processes, and strengthen supplier relationships.</p>
<p>One major benefit of this strategy is the consolidation of multiple product options, providing customers with a <strong>single eCommerce destination and a simpler, unified shopping experience.</strong><br />
Let&#8217;s delve into some of the top online marketplace options in the US where you can start selling your products, and explore how a marketplace integrator can streamline the integration process.</p>
<h3><b>Amazon</b></h3>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16152 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amazon-screen.jpg" alt="Amazon marketplace" width="750" height="376" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amazon-screen.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amazon-screen-480x241.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /><b></b></h3>
<p>Amazon Marketplace U.S. is not only the most recognized U.S. marketplace but boasts <a href="https://amzscout.net/blog/amazon-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the industry’s biggest numbers</a>. These include 310 million active users (80% of whom are based in the U.S.), an estimated two billion web visitors a month, and more than 600 million products.</p>
<p>On the flip side, there are also more than two million sellers already using Amazon as an eCommerce channel, and about 1.1 million of them are specifically using the company’s online marketplace in the USA.</p>
<p>Selling on Amazon generally happens in several ways. Traditionally, sellers could opt for the <b>Vendor Central</b> or wholesale approach, where products are sold in bulk to Amazon. While this is a straightforward way to get your products listed, it means you’re losing any control over the final price of customer lists.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fulfillment by Merchant (FBM)</b> means you’ll handle logistics and delivery yourself. You’ll either need to have strong in-house logistics capabilities or another partner that can meet the requirements of Amazon’s service levels. These include selling products on time, an order cancellation rate of less than .5%, and adherence to Amazon’s return policy. FBM means fewer Amazon fees and more control over your inventory, but also greater responsibility and focus on getting products to customers rather than marketing and selling to them.</li>
<li><b>Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA)</b>, on the other hand, means the company will not only list your products in its USA marketplace but handle storing, picking, packing, and shipping your products. Choosing FBA means you benefit from Amazon Prime shipping rates, can have products featured on the Buy Box where customers see “Add to Cart” or “Buy Now” and Amazon’s customer service capabilities. The downside? There are fees associated with this, of course, so calculate your return on investment (ROI) for both options before deciding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon sells many of the products in its marketplace itself, of course, which means you have to approach it strategically.</p>
<p><b>Some best practices include: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Enroll in the<a href="https://brandservices.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Amazon brand registry</a>, which offers tools to protect your intellectual property and improve your customer experience</li>
<li>Once you’ve enrolled in the registry, explore tools such as Amazon A+ Content (previously known as Enhanced Brand Content or EBC), which allows you to include additional product information and images to your listing and make them more compelling for eCommerce shoppers</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers/zgbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monitor Amazon best sellers</a> to see which products might be trending and whether or not that will affect your eCommerce strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>eBay</b></h3>
<h2><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16157 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ebay-screen.jpg" alt="ebay marketplace" width="750" height="376" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ebay-screen.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ebay-screen-480x241.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></h2>
<p>With 133 million active users, eBay is another of the online marketplace USA giants. It’s also a good example of how online shopping behavior is shifting from desktops to smartphones. In fact, <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2023/06/ebay-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">58% of sales on eBay’s U.S. marketplace happen on mobile devices</a>. The company also boasts 18 million sellers, which range from everyday consumers getting rid of junk in their attics to sizable retail brands.</p>
<p>Selling on eBay’s U.S. marketplace means bearing in mind the various fees that are associated with the process. This includes insertion fees for listing products, “final value” fees once a product sells, and optional fees to upgrade listings such as bold fonts, subtitles, and a minimum/reserve price.</p>
<p>To sell on eBay, you’ll have to adopt its proprietary <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sellercenter/payments-and-fees/payments-and-earnings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managed payments system</a>, where revenue payouts can be scheduled or made on demand.</p>
<p>Like all major USA marketplaces, eBay continually tries to improve the seller experience. Some of the most recent updates include <a href="https://www.ebay.ca/sellercentre/resources/seller-updates/2023-summer/business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tools to resolve payment disputes and block inappropriate messages</a>, for example, as well as <a href="https://www.ebay.ca/sellercentre/resources/seller-updates/2023-summer/listing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dynamic ad rates for promoted listings and ad rate forecasts</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/static/inventory/matching-products.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Integrating </a>with eBay’s USA online marketplace can work as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have your developers choose <b>eBay’s Inventory API or Trading API</b> to create or revise a product listing and match your product to those in the eBay catalog</li>
<li>Include whatever product details are necessary based on the eBay product category. Common attributes of all categories include <b>Titles, Identifiers, Descriptions, Product Aspects, and Stock Photos</b>.</li>
<li>Use a search call within the <b>Catalog API</b> to find products that match those within your online inventory.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b style="font-size: 22px;">Walmart Marketplace</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16156 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wallmart-screen.jpg" alt="Selling on walmart marketplace" width="750" height="376" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wallmart-screen.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wallmart-screen-480x241.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It may be best known for its vast physical store locations, but Walmart’s online capabilities have made it a huge eCommerce destination as well. In its most recent <a href="https://marketplace.walmart.com/2023-playbook-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seller playbook</a>, Walmart said sellers on its online USA marketplace have seen gross merchandise value (GSV) skyrocket by an average of 50%. This could be because 85% of Walmart customers make at least one online purchase a month, according to the company.</p>
<p>Walmart tries to help brands on its online USA marketplace stand out through Sponsored Search Ads, and like Amazon, it offers fulfillment services to handle many of the common post-purchase chores.</p>
<p>Since it works on a commission basis, <a href="https://marketplace.walmart.com/about-walmart-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart Marketplace</a> doesn’t charge initial setup or monthly/annual fees. It also offers what it describes as lucrative referral fees. The bar for getting on board as a seller is higher, however. Its criteria include a demonstrated “history of the marketplace of eCommerce success,” a catalog that complies with its prohibited products policy, and proof you’re working with a B2C warehouse if you don’t use Walmart’s fulfillment services.</p>
<p>Integrating with Walmart Marketplace can take a few forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <b>a third-party online marketplace USA solution provider</b>, a selection of which Walmart has curated on its marketplace site</li>
<li>Manually <b>search for Walmart’s Item Management APIs</b> and have your internal developers test with the provided XML Schema Definition in Walmart’s API sandbox<br />
.</li>
<li>Set up a profile on Walmart’s online Seller Center and try using <b>Setup By Match, Single Item, or Bulk Upload Setup</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Target Plus™</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16155 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/target-plus-screen.jpg" alt="Target plus marketplace" width="750" height="376" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/target-plus-screen.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/target-plus-screen-480x241.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://plus.target.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Target Plus™</b></a> operates as an invite-only marketplace, making it an exclusive space for carefully vetted brands and retailers. By being part of it, you have access to a wide audience of online shoppers without having to worry about the burdensome competition that a brand would experience with other marketplaces like Amazon. As of 2023, <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/targets-curated-marketplace-turns-four" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target’s U.S. marketplace</a> has only about 650 sellers, which may make it less competitive than other platforms. Target also enjoys 200 million visits a month on its site, which represents a sizable customer base.</p>
<p>This is an invite-only platform, which means you have the added benefit of SKU exclusivity, allowing a more strategic product assortment for the most value.</p>
<p>Integration with Target Plus™ platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Use FTP or API to upload your products.</b><b><br />
</b>A third-party integrator can manage product and inventory updates, as well as Target Plus™ product orders, to seamlessly and effortlessly connect you with its default marketplace side integrator.</li>
</ul>
<p>What you’ll get?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Reduced backorders and oversold items</b><b><br />
</b>Some third-party integrators have marketplace inventory rules that can help reduce backorders and overselling issues.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Improved reach with a credible brand</b><b><br />
</b>Additional capabilities improve customers’ ability to find your products, and increase overall exposure and reach while reaping the benefit of being backed by a credible and established American brand name and identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Belk</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16154 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/belck-screen.jpg" alt="Belk marketpalce" width="750" height="376" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/belck-screen.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/belck-screen-480x241.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.belk.com/customer-service/policies-guidelines/vendor-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Belk</b></a> is an established, popular chain of department stores throughout the US that offers apparel, cosmetics, and home goods, and garners over $4 billion in annual revenue. As of 2023 it also sits at No. 7 for eCommerce an online marketplace USA ranking, with <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/belk.com/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15.2 million estimated monthly visits</a>. With these figures, it’s easy to understand how beneficial it can be to integrate with this marketplace.</p>
<p>Integration with Belk:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Product listings</b><b><br />
</b>When integrating with Belk, you are required to submit your products in the form of an Excel file. Alternatively, you can use a third-party integrator to list your products, in the format of your preference. Their platform will generate the required Excel file and submit it on your behalf, saving you plenty of time in the process.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Order shipment requirements</b><b><br />
</b>Belk is known to have strict order shipment requirements; If a shipment is not made on time, you will be penalized. When you submit order shipment data to a third-party integration platform, and if you have multiple marketplace integrations, the shipment data can easily be scaled – providing a uniform and consistent shipment language across multiple marketplaces at once.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Order side synchronization</b><b><br />
</b>Thanks to its versatile transformations, some integration solutions can make order-side synchronization highly effective and simple, being able to use multiple file formats, including XML through shared folders. With this feature, you don’t need to worry about exporting certain file types or working with unfamiliar formats, as the platform handles it all ensuring consistency throughout all communications.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Frequent product updates</b><b><br />
</b>Product data updates will take place as frequently as once a day, while inventory can be updated hourly, meaning you can rest assured knowing that your product listings are always up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

A proper pricing strategy can help you increase sales, improve profitability, and maintain a competitive edge in the marketplace. In this blog post, we will discuss the fundamental principles of an effective Amazon pricing strategy and provide tips for sellers to maximize their profits.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="1">Understanding the Amazon Marketplace</h2>
<p>As an Amazon seller, understanding how to choose the right price for your products is essential for your success. It can be a challenge to determine the best pricing strategy for your products, especially for resellers competing with other companies that may be selling the exact same product.</p>
<p>The following tips will help you better understand pricing on the Amazon marketplace better.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Research</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Amazon</b> <b>Sellers&#8217;</b> <b>Pricing: </b>To choose the right price for your product on Amazon, research your competitor’s offering related products. You can use Amazon&#8217;s search function to find products like yours and compare their prices. Look for products with equivalent features, quality, and customer reviews. By comparing your product to other products, you can establish a competitive price range to stick with.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Determine Your Target Audience: </b>To decide the right price for your product on Amazon, you need to know who your target audience is. Amazon has a vast customer base, and learning who your product appeals to and how much they are willing to pay for it can help you understand the threshold of how high or low you should set your pricing. You can use<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/analytics-demographics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Amazon&#8217;s customer demographics</a> data to discover who your target audience is and their purchasing habits. This will help you choose a price that is appealing to your target market while also providing you with a reasonable profit margin.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Consider</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>Production: </b>Sellers that manufacture their products need to factor in the cost of production to develop a profitable product price on Amazon, This includes the cost of materials, manufacturing, shipping, and any expenses related to producing your product. Set a price that covers your costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. It would help if you also consider your overhead costs, such as manufacturing, operations, and marketing, which will affect your pricing strategy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Choose</b> <b>a</b> <b>Fair</b> <b>Price</b> <b>for</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Product</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Amazon</b> <b>Marketplace: </b>Once you have researched your competitor’s pricing, considered your cost of production, and determined your target audience, it&#8217;s time to set a fair price for your product on Amazon.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Aim for a price that is competitive with other sellers, covers your cost of production, and provides a reasonable profit margin. Pricing too high or too low can impact your sales and revenue, so it&#8217;s important to find the right balance.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="2">Monitoring your competitor’s prices on Amazon</h2>
<p>By monitoring your competitor’s product prices, you can adjust your pricing strategy according to how sellers are pricing their products. If your prices are too high, customers will choose to buy from cheaper options. If your prices are too low, you may not make a profit. By keeping track of your competitors&#8217; prices, you can make an informed decision on how high or low you’re willing to go. Here are some tips on how to monitor your competitors&#8217; prices effectively.</p>
<h3>Manually keep an eye on your competitors&#8217; prices</h3>
<p>To monitor your competitors&#8217; prices, one option is to manually monitor their pricing strategies by searching for similar products on Amazon. Keep track of any changes in their pricing and adjust your pricing strategy accordingly. By staying up to date with your competitors&#8217; pricing, you can make informed decisions about your own pricing strategy and stay competitive in the marketplace.</p>
<h3>Use automated tools to monitor competitor prices and adjust yours accordingly</h3>
<p>There are many tools available to help you monitor your competitors&#8217; prices and adjust your prices. Some third-party tools, such as <a href="https://www.junglescout.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jungle Scout</a>, <a href="https://www.helium10.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helium 10</a>, and <a href="https://perpetua.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perpetua</a>, offer pricing automation features to help you stay ahead of the competition.</p>
<p><b>When using these tools, it’s worth considering:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Cost of your production</li>
<li>Overhead expenses</li>
<li>Desired profit margin</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use these tools to monitor your competitors&#8217; prices and update your prices accordingly.</p>
<p>Another option is to use Amazon’s Repricing Tool which allows you to automatically adjust your prices based on your competitors&#8217; prices.</p>
<h3>How Amazon’s Repricing Tool Works:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Develop Your Pricing Strategy:</b> First, create your pricing strategy by defining the minimum and maximum prices for your products. You can also set rules for the repricing algorithm to follow, such as a minimum profit margin or a maximum price decrease</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Monitor Competitor Prices:</b> Amazon Repricer then monitors the prices of your competitors&#8217; products in real-time. It analyzes the prices and data points, such as product reviews, ratings, and sales volume, to determine the optimal price for your products</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Reprice Your Products:</b> Based on your pricing strategy and the data analysis, Amazon Repricer automatically adjusts the prices of your products. It can increase or decrease the prices within the price range and according to your rules</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Monitor Your Performance:</b> The tool then monitors the seller&#8217;s performance, such as sales volume, profit margin, and Buy Box percentage. It provides reports and analytics to help you optimize your pricing strategy to stay ahead of your competition</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Amazon’s tool automates your pricing strategy and takes the manual work out of adjusting prices. By using this tool wisely, you can save time to increase your sales and profits.</p>
<h2 id="3">Win Amazon’s Buy Box</h2>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s Buy Box is a coveted spot for sellers, as it is the default option for customers to add items to their cart.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Winning the Buy Box:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increased visibility</li>
<li>Higher sales</li>
<li>More revenue</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing is a significant factor to win the Buy Box but it’s not the only thing that Amazon looks at when deciding what products to feature.</p>
<p><b>Focus on:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining a high seller rating and positive customer feedback</li>
<li>Fast and reliable shipping</li>
<li>Having items in stock</li>
<li>Fulfilling orders on time</li>
</ul>
<p>Another factor influencing your chance of being featured in the Buy Box is using <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA)</b></a>. You have the advantage of guaranteeing fast and reliable shipping, and you can improve metrics like delivery time and inventory management which may lead to a better customer experience and more positive reviews.</p>
<p>Overall, winning Amazon’s Buy Box requires a combination of factors, and it’s wise to continually monitor and improve these to increase your chances of being featured there.</p>
<h2 id="4">Test and tweak your Amazon Seller Pricing Strategy</h2>
<p>As an Amazon seller, the set-and-forget pricing strategy may work for some brands and retailers but to maximize your profits your pricing will likely need to change.</p>
<p>Think about implementing the following activities to inform your ongoing pricing strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Conduct thorough market research</b> to determine the average price range for other products in your category. This information can help you set a competitive price point that is attractive to customers while still providing you with a reasonable profit margin</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Experiment with different pricing strategies</b>, such as offering discounts or bundling products. You can also try A/B testing by adjusting the price of your product for a short time and monitoring how it affects sales. This will help you determine the optimal price point for your product</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Pay close attention to customer feedback and reviews </b>about their product’s pricing. If customers are consistently complaining about the price of your product, it may be time to adjust your pricing strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>By constantly testing and tweaking your pricing strategy, it’s easier to stay competitive and profitable in the ever-changing world of e-commerce.</p>
<h2 id="5">Consider the impact of Amazon Promotions and Discounts</h2>
<p>While discounts and promotions can attract customers and increase sales, they can also reduce profit margins and devalue your brand. This is why it’s critical to <b>analyze the impact of your promotions and discounts on both your short-term and long-term profitability.</b></p>
<p>Another factor to consider when setting up a promotion is the <a href="https://Suvae.org/how-to-create-a-product-data-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structure of your product feed</a> and the timing of your promotion. If Amazon is pulling the incorrect promotion price or the price isn’t updated frequently enough to display the correct price at the right time, your profitability could be compromised.</p>
<blockquote><p>To get a good ROI from your promotions, <b>monitor how your discounts affect your customer’s loyalty and product demand</b>. Understanding the impact of these strategies will allow you to make informed decisions that benefit your business in the long run.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="6">How an experienced Amazon Marketplace Integrator can help</h2>
<p>The countless hours on product data optimizations and manual price updates retailers spend can sometimes equate to a full-time job, especially when you factor in your technical team’s time to do your initial integration. By<b> outsourcing your Amazon integration and feed management to an experienced provider,</b> you can significantly <b>reduce the time and effort required to manage your listings effectively.</b></p>
<p>Here are some key benefits to expect when working with a Marketplace Integration Solution provider:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Streamlined</b> <b>operations</b><b>:</b> An integrator can manage your pricing updates and product data optimizations across multiple marketplaces globally, reducing your manual effort and freeing up valuable time for other business activities</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Expert</b> <b>support</b><b>:</b> An experienced provider can help you seamlessly connect your product data to Amazon and additional marketplaces, while also staying up-to-date with continuously changing marketplace interfaces and requirements</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Enhanced</b> <b>exposure</b><b>:</b> A <a href="https://Suvae.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketplace Integrator </a>can help optimize your product listings and increase exposure on marketplaces. They have valuable expertise from working closely with these platforms, allowing you to improve your product listings and gain more visibility</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Scalability</b><b>:</b> After integrating with Amazon, a Marketplace Integrator can help you onboard with relevant marketplaces to expand your sales. Providers can offer insight into global and local marketplaces to help you make informed decisions to grow your product sales</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>Optimizing your Amazon pricing strategy is a critical component of success on the platform. By using the right pricing tactics and tools, you can maximize your sales, increase your profit margins, and gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. It&#8217;s important to remember that pricing is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process that requires constant monitoring and adjustment. Regularly analyze your competitors&#8217; pricing, monitor your performance metrics, and adjust your strategy accordingly. With a <b>data-driven approach </b>and a willingness to experiment and adapt, you can <b>refine your pricing strategy and take your Amazon sales to the next level.</b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you step onto West 34th Street in New York City, there’s no missing Macy’s iconic flagship store, and experienced shoppers know exactly what to expect. Once inside, they’ll find a vast assortment of merchandise carefully selected from some of their favorite brands. That’s similar to the kind of experience Macy’s wants to offer luxury shoppers online, as they explore the premium products curated for its digital marketplace.</p>
<h2>About Macy’s Marketplace</h2>
<p>Featuring more than 20 product categories including beauty, wellness, and gifting,<a href="https://www.macysinc.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/1788/macys-launches-its-curated-digital-marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Macy’s launched its digital marketplace</a> in the fall of 2022. This not only opens up access to would-be Macy’s customers who live far beyond the Big Apple. It also creates incredible opportunities for sellers that make it part of their omnichannel marketing and sales strategy.</p>
<p>Macy’s has said it will offer sellers tools to monitor and drive customer activity to further their growth. On the front end, the retail giant said customers should expect a seamless experience as they shop, have products shipped, or when need to process returns.</p>
<p>The launch of Macy’s digital marketplace was closely followed by<a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/bloomingdales-emperia-virtual-department-store-holidays/637007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a similar initiative from Bloomingdale’s, which debuted its own multi-brand eCommerce store</a> shortly before the holiday season.</p>
<h2>Why Marketplace Customer Experience Matters</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="img-inside-post aligncenter wp-image-15045 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/macys-marketplace.jpg" alt="Macys marketplace" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/macys-marketplace.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/macys-marketplace-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Retailers like Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s are part of a larger trend that is transforming the way brands are thinking about the best ways to reach customers and expand their volume of customer relationships. Since 2020, for instance,<a href="https://www.beshapingthefuture.co.uk/insights/online-marketplace-payments-to-hit-usd-8-7-trillion-by-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> online marketplaces have made up 53% of business-to-consumer (B2C) online sales</a>. This has put the overall digital marketplace segment on a path to a projected $8.7 trillion in payments by 2025.</p>
<p>Online marketplaces are powerful tools for retailers that want to embrace curation at scale, offering existing customers a greater assortment and expanded offerings to attract new customers. These same advantages benefit the sellers who participate in online marketplaces, but only if they execute effectively as they integrate with them.</p>
<h2>What Marketplace Integrators are, and how they can help</h2>
<p><a href="https://Suvae.org/multi-marketplace-integration-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Integrating with digital marketplaces</a> on your own can require significant in-house technology expertise. It also means taking your most talented technical professionals and putting them on a project that potentially takes them away from other opportunities.</p>
<p>Given the pace of change, meanwhile, there can be a significant effort to continue integrating with each new marketplace and understanding its particular needs.</p>
<p>Third-party marketplace integration services provide the expertise and experience necessary to accelerate the process of selling properties from the likes of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s. They also have more resources to stay ahead of the technology requirements of online marketplaces as they evolve.</p>
<h2>Macy’s Marketplace Integration made easy</h2>
<p>At Highstreet, for example,<a href="https://Suvae.org/marketplace-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> marketplace integration services</a> include <strong>connecting sellers to properties</strong> like Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s and capturing customer orders. Suvae.org also manages processes such as the acknowledgment that an order has shipped, as well as data around product returns.</p>
<p>Uploading<a href="https://Suvae.org/inventory-management-tools-for-multichannel-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> inventory data</a> to the marketplace is fully automated, which <strong>saves sellers time and reduces the risk of errors</strong>. Instead of disappointing customers by promoting products that are no longer in stock, sellers can avoid high cancellation rates, which on some marketplaces can lead to penalties.</p>
<p>A marketplace integration service like Suvae.org is also experienced in <strong>helping sellers with content mapping</strong>. This is the process of translating data about product colors, sizing, and pricing so they appear as the correct values on a marketplace such as Macy’s or Bloomingdale’s. When catalogs can contain hundreds or even thousands of products, it’s critical to map content accurately to ensure a great shopping experience on sites like Macy’s marketplace.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Marketplace integrators have proven approaches to ensure high-quality results for digital sellers. This includes testing the connection between the seller’s inventory and Suvae.org, for example, to ensure inventory is being updated at the right frequency and without mistakes on Macy’s or Bloomingdale’s, and that all orders are being properly captured. This is an important phase of the integration process that will<strong> put sellers in a better position to promote their products</strong> in these kinds of environments.</p>
<p>As more premium retailers like Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s develop exceptional shopping destinations online, being ready to participate in digital marketplaces will become an essential element in successful eCommerce.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As leisure travel skyrockets, consumers are increasing their spending on the world’s top eCommerce search engine from previous years. It&#8217;s almost like the back-to-school season, but instead of buying pens and binders, your customers are looking for clothing, books, and anything and everything that will ensure their perfect holiday.</p>
<p>Looking at summer sales on Amazon, eMarketer expects <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/what-expect-during-amazon-s-prime-day-sale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon’s Prime Day sales event will generate $12.52 billion in worldwide revenues</a> this year, a year-over-year (YoY) gain of 17.0%, per their new forecast.</p>
<p>So how do you get your Amazon Product listings optimized so they’ll be found by vacationers with money to spend?</p>
<p>It starts with understanding what Amazon product listings are and how consumers use the platform to find what they’re looking for. It may sound straightforward, but as you’ll learn in this post, there are many factors to succeed on the world’s top eCommerce search engine.</p>
<h2>What are Amazon Product Listings</h2>
<p>Before online shopping, customers that knew exactly what product they were looking for could call the store and put it on hold or go into the store and describe the product by referencing the brand, color, name, material, and any other unique features.</p>
<p>On Amazon, your listing contains all the information on your product page. Amazon does the searching, and the products displayed heavily rely on the data you’ve included with your Amazon product listings.</p>
<p>Basic product listing details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product ID</li>
<li>Model Number</li>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Color</li>
<li>Brand</li>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Image</li>
<li>Shipping Details</li>
</ul>
<p>You provide this information either with a feed or an API specific to Amazon’s requirements.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that not all listings are the same. There could be three resellers listing the same product on Amazon, and their product information could be slightly different.</p>

<p>To get more details on how to list your products, check out Amazon’s <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/202073140?language=en-US&amp;ref=mpbc_200463270_cont_202073140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Listing Guidelines</a>.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Selling on Amazon</h2>
<p>Picture the world’s biggest, most busy shopping center with an endless variety of products: this is what Amazon would be like as a physical marketplace. It’s the largest eCommerce retailer by online revenue in the world. The <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1218313/amazon-revenue-development-ecommercedb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net sales from Amazon.com alone skyrocketed in 2022 to 162,360 million US dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can benefit from selling your products on Amazon:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The ability to use Amazon FBA </b>(Fulfillment by Amazon) to store and ship your products for a low price allowing your customers the ability to use their Prime membership to get deals on free or inexpensive shipping and short shipping times.</li>
<li><b>Expand internationally</b> for a lower cost and less labor than setting up global distribution on your own.</li>
<li><b>Be where your customers are.</b> If your customers are on Amazon, it makes sense to list your products where they shop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep reading to find out how your customers use the platform and search around the platform to find products like yours.</p>
<h2>How Customers Find Your Product Listing</h2>
<p>Like browsing in a physical store, the same shopper that was frantically looking for a phone case yesterday could be back today with more time to browse different brands and promotions.</p>
<p>Picturing your customer&#8217;s shopping scenarios isn’t the hard part. To get maximum product exposure, you must understand how Amazon’s platform delivers your product listings.</p>
<h3>What to know about Amazon Categories</h3>
<p>Imagine a perfectly merchandised brick-and-mortar shop where shoppers can find what they’re looking for at a quick glance.<br />
In her ideal shopping experience, a female customer looking for running shoes walks into the shoe section and immediately sees the Women’s section, an Athletic subsection, and Road Running within that section. Within minutes the shopper can make sense of the categories to find what she’s looking for. .</p>
<p><a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G200332540?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Categories on Amazon</a> work the same way. There are multiple ways to categorize your products, and the more you think like a shopper browsing in a store section, the better chance you have of being found.</p>
<p>You also need to consider the ultimate goal of earning the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GGGMZK378RQPATDJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Best Seller badge</a> to help boost your sales. For example, carefully selecting a niche category like “Road Running” in the Women’s shoe section will have less competition than “Women’s shoes,” resulting in a better chance to rank higher in sales.</p>
<p>Choosing the right category is a good first step to getting in front of more customers, but there are more factors to consider if you want to achieve the #1 best-seller spot.</p>
<h3>Getting your products on the Best Seller Page</h3>
<p>Best Seller products on Amazon are like the most popular items at the front of your store that are flying off the shelves. If you don’t buy them now, they may not be in stock when you return. You can find these items on their<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers/zgbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Best Seller page</a> and see them marked with the coveted “Best Seller” orange label.</p>
<p>Apple’s AirTag Cases are listed as an Amazon Best Seller this summer. They became popular when leisure travel peaked, and travelers dealt with busy airports and the potential for lost luggage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12610" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Apple-Air-Tag-Holder-Best-Seller-Amazon.jpg" alt="Apple Air Tag Holder Best Seller Amazon" width="750" height="173" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Apple-Air-Tag-Holder-Best-Seller-Amazon.jpg 750w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Apple-Air-Tag-Holder-Best-Seller-Amazon-480x110.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The orange badge can be challenging for you to attain but not impossible. You can achieve this status if you get the highest sales numbers in a specific category, which is calculated and updated hourly by sales history and velocity.</p>
<p>To help you build your sales and reach this level, you can leverage a few tactics to attract more customers to your listings. One of these methods is keyword optimization.</p>
<h3>How to be found using Amazon Keywords</h3>
<p>Similar to Google, the more specific information a shopper includes in their search, the better the chance they’ll find what they’re looking for.</p>
<p>For instance, if a travel shopper uses the keyword “sunscreen” but is looking for a “LaRoche Posay tinted moisturizer with sunscreen,” they’ll get two different sets of results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12612" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LaRoche-Posay-Tinted-Moisturizer-Amazon-Product-Listing.jpg" alt="LaRoche Posay Tinted Moisturizer Amazon Product Listing" width="751" height="475" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LaRoche-Posay-Tinted-Moisturizer-Amazon-Product-Listing.jpg 751w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LaRoche-Posay-Tinted-Moisturizer-Amazon-Product-Listing-480x304.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 751px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>This is where good Amazon keyword research helps shoppers find your products. There are two types of keywords to use in your product listings:</p>
<ol>
<li>primary keywords</li>
<li>hidden keywords (title &amp; description)</li>
</ol>
<p>Read more detail on how to <a href="https://Suvae.org/sell-using-amazon-product-listing-keywords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Sell More Using Amazon Product Listing Keywords</a></p>
<p>Choosing the right keywords is important but optimizing all of the data using Amazon product listing integration will give your products the best chance of being discovered.</p>
<h2>Tips for Amazon Product Listing Integration using Product Feeds</h2>
<p>Strolling through a department store, you’ll notice that the same item could be in multiple locations based on factors like brand, color, category, promotion, or popularity. Amazon uses your product data to decide where to place your items on its website. To connect your data, you need some technical expertise in marketplace integration.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for integrating your products and creating a product feed for Amazon:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <a href="https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Selling Partner API</a> to structure your product data to increase your product’s rankings and listings. This API includes a list of your stock and each item’s attributes.</li>
<li>Use Amazon’s <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/202073140?language=en-US&amp;ref=mpbc_200463270_cont_202073140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Listing Guidelines</a> and <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200390640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Detail Page Rules</a> to ensure you follow the right requirements to be approved</li>
<li>Download a <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G201576430?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product inventory file template</a> from Amazon to add your product data to create a data feed</li>
<li>To sell globally, register through <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Seller Central</a>. If Amazon is managing your product inventory, then your Amazon data feed requires a fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) flag</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the story of every successful eCommerce business, its inventory management tool is always the unsung hero. That’s as it should be.</p>
<p>When you’re running a luxury brand, you need to keep your customer focused on the digital experience they see, and of course the styles and quality of the products you’re selling.</p>
<p>Consumers should never have to think about the way you approach effective inventory management – even though it represents a critical element in keeping them satisfied and loyal.</p>
<h2>What is Inventory Management?</h2>
<p>You’re only as valuable to customers as your ability to supply them with what they want. That’s the real definition of inventory management: a way to eliminate the risk of disappointing shoppers.</p>
<p>Think through the typical eCommerce customer journey: they visit a website or marketplace and spend minutes or even hours contemplating a purchase.</p>
<p>When the moment of truth comes, they click “Buy” or “Add to cart.”</p>
<p>If the words “Item not in stock” comes up, the only option is to have them join a waitlist and to recommend alternate products. In many cases, of course, the customer will likely choose to shop elsewhere, perhaps never to return.</p>
<p>Inventory management is also critical during the fulfillment process. In fact, a recent survey found<a href="https://www.avionos.com/2022-consumer-data-study-hybrid-is-here-to-stay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> nearly half of consumers feel that delivering correct and accurate orders is essential to earning their trust</a>.</p>
<h2>Why use Omnichannel Inventory Management?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12404" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Why-use-omnichannel-inventory-management.png" alt="Why use omnichannel inventory management" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>Many brands find effective inventory management relatively simple if they are primarily focused on physical retail with only one or two locations.</p>
<p>Things get much more complex as you pursue a growth strategy, particularly as you add eCommerce channels beyond your own web site.<a href="https://Suvae.org/multi-marketplace-integration-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
Third-party marketplaces</a> such as Amazon or Zalando can offer exposure to a larger number of shoppers, for instance. Selling through social media services such as Facebook and Instagram, meanwhile, can ensure your brand is top of mind when consumers are ready to buy.</p>
<p>This is where brands typically look for a retail inventory management system.<br />
<a href="https://Suvae.org/new-omnichannel-shopping-experience-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operating as an omnichannel seller</a> depends upon being able keep on top of stock and respond to sudden changes in customer demand. You need real-time visibility into inventory and sales updates across every channel, along with integrations with third-party eCommerce platforms and advanced reporting capabilities.</p>
<p>According to a study of eCommerce merchants conducted earlier this year<a href="https://www.sclogistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-Fulfillment-Trends-Report-Saddle-Creek-Logistics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">, almost a quarter (22%) now operate three different distribution centers</a>. These warehouses may be spread across multiple countries or even continents. Choosing the right eCommerce inventory management software ensures you can decentralize the process of tracking and fulfilling orders and never giving customers an unpleasant surprise.</p>
<h2>How to overcome the complexity of Omnichannel Inventory Management for Marketplaces</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12402" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/How-to-overcome-the-complexity-of-omnichannel.jpg" alt="How to overcome the complexity of omnichannel" width="701" height="467" /></p>
<p>As you consider which inventory management tool is right for your brand, keep in mind the following considerations:</p>
<h3>Determine the scope and complexity of inventory splits</h3>
<p>Your business goals might include making your products available to any customer who wants them, regardless of location, but that means being able to manage your catalog at a per-warehouse level.</p>
<p>Traditional retail inventory management systems usually don’t offer inventory splitting to address specific marketplace or market scenarios. Unless you have the in-house capabilities to completely customize your tech stack, <b>inventory splitting is an essential component of an eCommerce inventory management system</b>.</p>
<h3>Evaluate the current and future cadence of inventory updates</h3>
<p>Perhaps you’re a retailer where inventory updates are happening once an hour, at which point the values of your products are changed across multiple third-party marketplaces.</p>
<p>As your sales activity continues to grow, however, that cadence might not be frequent enough to prevent stockouts and cancelled items. Marketplaces naturally frown upon merchants where this happens regularly because it reflects on their customer experience as well as the merchant.</p>
<p>Instead, look for an inventory management tool that can update marketplace inventory even more often than your eCommerce channel. With an order reservation algorithm, for instance, you’ll be able to support less frequent inventory updates for products that may have limited availability.</p>
<h3>Think through marketplace-specific needs for inventory thresholds</h3>
<p>A physical store operating in a bustling city will need to have more inventory on hand than one set up in a remote rural community. In a similar way, some marketplaces will prove more effective for you as a sales channel than others.</p>
<p>Make sure you opt for an eCommerce inventory management system that allows you to take a more <b>granular approach to controlling the minimum stock you’ll need to satisfy customer</b>s based on where they’re most likely to shop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Offering eCommerce on your site is sort of like hosting a party in your home, filled with people you know and some guests you welcome in for the first time.</p>
<p><a href="https://Suvae.org/marketplace-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extending your eCommerce capabilities through marketplace integration</a>, on the other hand, is like attending a high society gala, where you have the chance to significantly expand your social circle with a vast number of new connections.</p>
<p>A more obvious analogy is a retailer that not only sets up standalone stores but opens up additional locations within major shopping centers.<br />
Much like being present on social media platforms and search engines, multi-marketplace integration has proven key to success as an omnichannel retailer.</p>
<h2>Why Online Marketplaces are a Growth Driver for Omnichannel Retailers</h2>
<p>According to a survey conducted by PYMTS, for example, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/ecommerce/2022/the-data-point-61-pct-online-sellers-increased-marketplace-usage-in-past-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61% of online merchants say they have increased their marketplace usage</a> in the last year. This isn’t limited to a single third-party store such as Amazon, either. The research showed that <strong>42% of retailers sell through four or more marketplaces.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12280 size-full" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Why-online-marketplaces-are-a-growth-driver.jpg" alt="Why-online-marketplaces-are-a-growth-driver" width="700" height="469" srcset="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Why-online-marketplaces-are-a-growth-driver.jpg 700w, https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Why-online-marketplaces-are-a-growth-driver-480x322.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>The traditional drawback of listing products on sites such as Mango, Lamoda, Zalando, and others has been the cost and effort <a href="https://Suvae.org/onboard-multiple-online-marketplaces-effectively/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">onboarding</a> required.<br />
Some of the potential bottlenecks have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty managing inventory and orders across multiple marketplaces at once</li>
<li>Managing customer relationships across more than one third-party store</li>
<li>Lack of consistent branding and messaging from one store to another</li>
<li>Difficulty controlling pricing, logistics, and custom interactions</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is eCommerce Marketplace Integration?</h2>
<p>The rise of eCommerce marketplace integration services is providing online retailers a way to transcend these issues by unifying data from multiple sources.</p>
<p>By using an application programming interface (API) for example, marketplace integration tools can act as a two-way link that connects a single selling platform to many different third-party stores at once.<br />
This includes connecting to inventory, mapping product uploads to their proper category, transferring data, syncing across channels, and fulfilling orders in real-time.</p>
<p>Once eCommerce marketplace integration has been deployed, you can syndicate your product listings and catalogs to multiple online marketplaces.<br />
Also, you can more easily<strong> track and manage orders, keep stock of inventory, and spend more time focusing on nurturing customer relationships.</strong></p>
<h2>How eCommerce Marketplace Integration Services Work</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12282" src="https://Suvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/How-marketplace-integration-services-work.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>Your goal with marketplace integration should be to reach a point of “agnostic eCommerce.” In other words, you want to be focused on simply driving sales, without having to worry about which marketplace your orders are coming from.</p>
<p>Achieving this without putting undue burdens on developers means working with an expert eCommerce marketplace service partner that can identify the best approach.</p>
<p>These can vary depending on the retailer but include:</p>
<h3>Complete and thorough object specifications</h3>
<p>While customer activity might look different from one third-party store to another, there might be common use cases in terms of what’s required to support taxation, returns, refunds, and partial orders.<br />
Choose the order schemas that apply to the majority of your orders to<strong> simplify the integration process.</strong></p>
<h3>Extensible object specifications</h3>
<p>Even in a well-run eCommerce operation, anomalies or exceptions to the rule will occasionally come up.<br />
Talk to your marketplace integration provider about how they can <strong>handle custom properties</strong>, such as pairs of names and values, or other unforeseen<strong> data requirements.</strong></p>
<h3>Acceptable actions<b><i></i></b></h3>
<p>The more you can automate eCommerce processes, the more streamlined your company is and the greater the potential for increased sales.<br />
By specifying a list of what actions the integration tool can take depending on the API response and payloads, you’ll have <strong>greater confidence in the status of your orders.</strong></p>
<h3>Configurable process sequences</h3>
<p>Talk to your partner about the way you’ll handle pre-accepted orders, or when orders are postponed after an inventory check.<br />
Doing so will offer <strong>greater consistency in the customer experience you deliver,</strong> no matter what marketplace they’re using to shop for your products.</p>
<h3>Escape routes</h3>
<p>What if none of the above tactics work? The best market integration service providers know that sometimes it’s necessary to leverage specific fields in the order schema.<br />
This is a way of programmatically determining which marketplace is being used and <strong>allowing orders to be processed smoothly.</strong></p>
<h2>Master the art of eCommerce Order Management across third-party stores</h2>
