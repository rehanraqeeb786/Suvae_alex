										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even with an unlimited shopping budget, no one would order a complete wardrobe of luxury goods that they would have to wear for the rest of their lives. Styles change, personal preferences evolve and some clothing and accessories wear out and need to be replaced. Instead, we assemble our wardrobes and bring new pieces in and out as required – similar to the way MACH architecture is changing how brands are starting to look at the tech stack powering their eCommerce capabilities.</p>
<p>A few years ago, marketing research firm Gartner described this as a shift to <a href="https://www.gartner.ca/en/articles/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a composable enterprise</a>, where organizations would adopt technology like a series of interchangeable building blocks. This would lead to greater speed, flexibility, and resilience, its analysts said.<br />
Achieving composability as a business may sound like a lofty goal, which is why the MACH architecture brings together all the principles that you can keep in mind to ensure you’re choosing the right solutions along the way.</p>
<h2>What is MACH architecture?</h2>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/tip/A-quick-intro-to-the-MACH-architecture-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MACH architecture backgrounder</a> on TechTarget noted, MACH is more of a concept that businesses should use to develop a strategy rather than a one-size-fits-all blueprint.<br />
The four principles include:</p>
<h3>Microservices-based</h3>
<p>No one wants to encounter the “domino effect” in software, where you touch one piece of an application and it affects every other part. Microservices avoids this by treating each application function on an individual basis. That makes it easier to update, enhance or remove specific services more readily than you could with monolithic applications.</p>
<h3>API-first</h3>
<p>For a long time, internal development teams within organizations or those within vendor companies would begin writing code and even launch applications, then realize their work wasn’t done. They might need to integrate with other tools or add some kind of enhancements. This often leads to a search for the right application programming interface (API). An API-first approach puts the horse before the cart, understanding that starting with APIs will give them more options later on.</p>
<h3>Cloud-native</h3>
<p>Similarly, many applications that were initially developed to be installed on a company’s own premises have been revamped over the past number of years to run in the cloud. This includes many CRM systems, ERPs, and marketing software tools. Today, <a href="https://highstreet.io/saas-integration-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the advantages of a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model</a> have led to a cloud-native approach, where applications take full advantage of the elasticity, scale, and resilience of public, private, and hybrid cloud environments.</p>
<h3>Headless</h3>
<p>When many brands set up their first eCommerce sites, they were limited by content management systems that forced them to stick with the user interface (UI) that came with it. Today they have more options, thanks to headless commerce tools that decouple components like the UI from the back end where product data and other information are stored. This has eased the path for rendering content across mobile devices, wearables, and even “smart mirrors” in their store locations.</p>
<h2>MACH architecture example</h2>
<p>Several well-known brands are already demonstrating compelling MACH architecture example use cases. As Diginomica reported, pet food giant <a href="https://diginomica.com/mach-two-enterprise-adoption-learnings-mars-ikea-asics-interflora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mars Inc., furniture retailer Ikea, and Interflora are all moving to MACH solutions</a> to improve the way they operate.</p>
<p>The article also profiled footwear brand ASICS, which sees MACH as a way of providing richer product data, such as details on how many of its running shoes have information about heel drops. Focusing on MACH principles is allowing the company to deploy solutions that will surface more of what customers want to know amid omnichannel shopping experiences.</p>
<h2>MACH architecture pros and cons</h2>
<p>Companies don’t change the way they adopt IT very often, and there can be an understandable reluctance to upgrade or migrate to solutions that aren’t fully mature. Deciding on whether MACH architecture is right for you will come down to weighing the following:</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<p><b>Greater uptime</b><br />
Having an application crash or lag can have a detrimental impact on the business, particularly when you’re trying to sell to customers online. MACH solutions can help avoid this scenario because microservices, for instance, allow for greater fault isolation. That means pieces of an application can be remedied before a problem cascades to the rest. A brand’s digital presence can have higher availability as a result.</p>
<p><b>Faster upgrades</b><br />
Brands may often be interested in bringing on new tools to assist with their sales, marketing, and online orders, but need to check first that solutions will mesh with what they already have in place. The composable nature of MACH solutions provides a more streamlined and accelerated path to integrating with a greater variety of applications and tools. This in turn could help brands gain a competitive advantage or speed up the time to market with features that customers want from a digital experience.</p>
<p><b>Scaleable growth</b><br />
More customers, more orders, a greater mix of inventory – nothing should get in the way of brands increasing the rate at which they achieve their business goals. When IT can’t deal with large volumes of data or creates other impediments, it’s obviously not going to provide the expected return on investment. Opting for MACH solutions could provide peace of mind that they can grow at an exponential level without significant risk their IT will fail to keep up.</p>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<p><b>Lack of expertise</b><br />
Many brands may not employ enough (or any) in-house developers who can create their own bespoke MACH architecture. This can be mitigated by working with trusted technology partners that have already developed their solutions based on MACH principles</p>
<p><b>More tools</b><br />
MACH solutions that are developed or deployed internally may require additional tools to monitor and manage their performance. In other cases, however, SaaS tools will have measurement and reporting capabilities built into the core product</p>
<p><b>Legacy issues</b><br />
Moving to MACH solutions could involve retiring older, monolithic applications that have been in place for some time. Rather than seeing this as a project calling for a complete revamp of your entire tech stack, look for specific areas where deploying a MACH solution will bring business value while putting you on the road to composability.</p>
<h2>Selecting MACH Solutions</h2>
<p>The criteria for what you need in a MACH architecture will depend on your business and its needs, but aim to cover these bases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose-built</strong>: You want best-of-breed building blocks that were designed with specific business outcomes in mind versus more generic, all-purpose solutions</li>
<li><strong>Pre-built integrations</strong>: APIs and webhooks should make it easy to bring on applications and tools without causing significant business disruption</li>
<li><strong>Strong SLAs</strong>: The most trusted SaaS solutions include service-level agreements that let you move forward with confidence</li>
<li><strong>Continuous delivery model</strong>: Automatic updates eliminate the risk of solutions becoming out of date or creating vulnerabilities</li>
<li><strong>Access to expertise</strong>: Look beyond the solution itself and establish that you’re working with a company whose team can guide your shift towards a MACH architecture</li>
</ul>
<h2>MACH solutions for eCommerce</h2>
<p>For areas such as <a href="https://highstreet.io/product-feed-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product feed management</a>, <a href="https://highstreet.io/marketplace-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketplace integration</a>, and <a href="https://highstreet.io/marketplace-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local inventory ads</a>, Highstreet.io offers an example of MACH architecture in action. This includes a <strong>cloud-native development path and sophisticated use of APIs,</strong> as well as pre-built integrations that make it easy to connect product listing to leading platforms such as <a href="https://highstreet.io/how-salesforce-commerce-cloud-integration-transforms-online-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salesforce Commerce Cloud</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to global marketplaces, it is clear that the post-pandemic era has unleashed a market already consolidated but that had not yet expressed all its potential. Brands of all types and sectors have begun to decline their online catalogs, not infrequently without the necessary skills in terms of mass management that catapulted on the web to buy, thus thinning too many ambitions and a few tools.</p>
<p>As one of the companies of Impresoft, <a href="https://kipcast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kipcast</a> has assumed in such a scenario, a fundamental role of &#8220;accompanying&#8221; company-customer towards the right plan of digital sales presence.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.impresoftgroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Impresoft</a>, today a true reservoir of innovation, was born in 2018 and immediately set an important objective: to become the largest IT player on the market. This is a goal to be achieved also through acquisitions and integrations with other organizations, as happened with Kipcast. As a result, Impresoft has set up four competence centers to cover the various needs of customers: Business Solutions, Industry Solutions, Customer Engagement, and Corporate Resilience.</p>
<p>It is a change of pace in some ways majestic, which will also require a restyling of the whole brand, so that you can tell, almost holistically, what the individual legal entities do.</p>
<h2>Kipcast Role</h2>
<p>As anticipated, Kipcast deals with a very dynamic industry, ranging from marketing to the online presence of brands in third-party stores. The company launched <a href="https://highstreet.io/platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Highstreet.io platform</a> on the market in 2015, to allow the simplification and optimization of product data distribution to all corporate third-party channels: marketing, store promotions, marketplace sales</p>
<p>The solution, in SaaS mode and hosted on the cloud, is already <strong>adopted by over 250 brands in the fashion industry, but also targets brands from other industries</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-15036 size-thumbnail alignnone" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Federico-Vittadello-150x150.jpg" alt="Federico Vittadello" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>As<b> Federico Vittadello</b>, VP of Business Development at Kipcast explains: «Our target audience is, in large part, that of large companies, which need to manage and distribute a wide range of data, but also to enjoy a platform that is as flexible as possible. The value which we bring to the world of customer engagement lies in the opportunity to work on software that promises a speed of execution and, as we will see, also quality». The first point deals with a non-trivial problem when the context requires quick and informed decision-making.</p>
<h2>The market is changing</h2>
<p>As the market is changing, it then becomes necessary to better control sales channels, also the ones different from their own, to know the competition and where the consumer aims. Highstreet.io works just like that while simplifying the various steps that companies need to take to launch on the global marketplace.</p>
<p>The primary directives to which Kipcast points are: first of all the automation of the presence of the brand on the marketplace thereby freeing its customer from an often burdensome task both in terms of time and money. «Moreover, as subjects operating for years in the world of online commerce, we can specifically advise brands, also suggesting which architectures to choose, thus laying a solid foundation for the project. Finally, being already integrated with marketplace platforms, once the negotiation process is over, at the technological level we speed up the launch of online products, from their loading to payment, return, and refund management, including special cases».</p>
<p>A key advantage of Kipcast is the consulting aspect that is offered from the start of each onboarding: «Knowing downstream the needs of the marketplace, as experts in the field, we can advise what is best for each customer» the manager concludes. So fluidity but also adaptability and customization of the platform, with vertical know-how that allows a brand to approach a market that presents new everyday challenges, in a much more serene way.</p>
<h2>What’s in the future of global marketplaces?</h2>
<p>Kipcast sees a trend that could soon take root: the approach, at least in terms of promotion and presentation, of B2B sales channels compared to traditional B2C ones.</p>
<p>«The dynamics seem to replicate, with obvious differences in the quantity of the products to buy and prices, but we see a kind of alignment of the logic underlying the flow of promotions. In such a scenario, the competence of Kipcast in <b>connecting the world of product offering with those who convey them to end customers</b> becomes fundamental for companies which want to extend their aims beyond the traditional horizons».</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tools you use to manage your eCommerce business are as valuable as the keys to a flagship store. Those systems contain priceless information about your inventory, your orders, and your </span><a href="https://highstreet.io/how-data-feed-management-enhances-your-digital-marketing-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">product feed that connect to online marketplaces and essential digital channels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>That’s why they need to be protected with the kind of security that AWS Cognito MFA (multi-factor authentication) can provide.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like showing an employee identification card when you show up in an office, authentication technologies are a way to confirm that only authorized people are logging into your backend infrastructure.<br />
For years, authentication was often limited to the use of passwords, even though they were often forgotten by employees and easy to guess by cybercriminals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides additional layers of protection to digital platforms</strong> by requiring additional credentials. These could include something you know, such as a PIN, sending a text to your smartphone, or even scanning biometric data like your fingerprint or your face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Highstreet.io, we’re reducing the burden on brands to<strong> focus on security and offer peace of mind by standardizing our user authentication</strong> based on AWS Cognito MFA.</span></p>
<p>This post offers some more detail on our approach, and why it will let you spend more time on the products you’re selling and the customers you’re serving.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platform Authentication – A Technical Choice Using AWS</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve standardized on AWS Cognito MFA because it was purposely designed to help organizations authenticate and manage users whether they’re looking into a web portal or a mobile app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Highstreet.io’s case, the main component for authentication is based on a directory of people who will need to access the platform, which is called a user pool.</span></p>
<p>This provides a seamless way to manage each user’s profile while also checking for suspicious activity such as an attempt by a hacker to take over someone’s account or to verify a credential like an e-mail address.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We like Cognito MFA because it’s scalable as more users get added, and it also allows customization at the user interface (UI) level, which means we can provide a front end that’s familiar and easy to use.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Components of the Infrastructure Authentication</span></h2>
<p>When you put a key in a lock, you don’t usually get to see the gears and other components that turn and allow you to open a door. The diagram below provides an insider view of what happens when your users are logging into Highstreet.io.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14191" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HS-authentication.drawio.jpg" alt="HS authentication drawio" width="750" height="360" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HS-authentication.drawio.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HS-authentication.drawio-480x230.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system makes use of Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), which are environments where application programming interfaces (APIs) can be created and run in isolation from the underlying hardware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re trying to authenticate who you are, the user pool grants tokens that authorize requests that get made to the containerized HTTP API.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve been authenticated, you can dive into Highstreet.io and begin </span><a href="https://highstreet.io/new-omnichannel-shopping-experience-retailers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">configuring your product feeds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more accurate ads, marketplace listings, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infrastructure as Code</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping this kind of backend infrastructure with the needs of a business would have traditionally required a lot of time and effort, but Highstreet.io’s use of infrastructure has changed all that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is infrastructure as code? Think of it as a way of using coding to automate complex processes rather than relying on manual (and often error-prone work).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More specifically, we learn about Terraform’s infrastructure as code software to create, change and improve our user authentication.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Highstreet.io stands: What you get as a Customer</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining infrastructure as code with AWS Cognito MFA, we’re able to provide a<strong> cost-effective, high-speed, consistent, and secure user authentication experience</strong> that benefits all our customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having complete control and visibility over who’s logging on at all times also means Highstreet.io can continuously improve our approach to AWS Cognito multi-factor authentication.<br />
Terraform helps us keep track of versioning so that changes to the underlying infrastructure can happen incrementally, as new eCommerce needs emerge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might not think about how users are logging into Highstreet.io on a day-to-day basis, or whether your organization is at any risk of an IT security incident. That’s a good sign we’re doing our jobs right – and another great reason to count on us as a <strong>trusted feed management partner.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Enhanced cooperation to provide eCommerce &amp; retail customers with increasingly innovative technology services.</h4>
<p>We are incredibly pleased to announce that <a href="https://www.gntechonomy.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GN Techonomy</a> and Kipcast have joined forces to become a new key player in the eCommerce integration business both from the product/service perspective and the more traditional bespoke integration approach. By providing joint customers with the ability to leverage pre-existing integration components and/or to rely on skilled developers for ad-hoc projects, the combined team of GN Techonomy and Kipcast will always be the most economical, less risky, and customer-tailored solution for their customers.</p>
<p>“<em>Becoming a key player in the eCommerce integration space has always been the ultimate goal for Kipcast. Initially, that meant providing feed management services for online digital marketing (Highstreet.io). Subsequently, we expanded by connecting local marketing services with store inventory to drive more customers to stores (Clicktobrick.io for local text searches). At last, marketplace integration and PIM/OMS integration have become the natural evolution of the Highstreet.io solution. Together with GN Techonomy, the aim is to provide one-stop-shop services for our customers.</em>&#8221; – Giovanni Guardalben, CEO of Kipcast.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gntechonomy.com/en/solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GN Techonomy</a> offers a suite of technological &amp; innovative enterprise solutions that varies from software configuration to customized consulting services, to help companies succeed in their digital transformation process. GN Techonomy 25 years of experience in the field of technology consultancy and integration, led to the creation of complete eCommerce &amp; omnichannel solutions which simplify all processes related to online shopping, improve marketing and communication strategies, and refine workflows through data automation and process optimization.</p>
<p>“<em>Creating an Italian technological hub that offers a complete suite of omnichannel solutions to ensure the growth of the online business is our key objective for the future. By seeking this purpose, we are pleased, as GN Techonomy, to partner with Kipcast: the aim is to together respond to the ever-changing needs of our customers through the continuous improvement of innovative products in data integration and feed management. Combining the skills and experience of both companies, we intend to offer a complete set of eCommerce and omnichannel technologies which allow retailers to communicate product information and update sales data across multiple channels and online shopping networks: i.e., marketplace, price comparison engines, advertising platforms, and social media. We strongly believe that Highstreet.io and Clicktobrick.io provide retail with real value improving marketing campaign optimization as well as sales performance.</em>” – Gualtiero Biella, Managing Director GN Techonomy.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, eCommerce purchases have increased significantly in Italy. Data from The eCommerce B2C Osservatorio of the School of Management Politecnico di Milano report shows a significant growth in online purchases by Italians in 2020: EUR 4.7 billion, or 26 percent more than in 2019. This growth has resulted in booming eCommerce performance for many companies while pushing retailers who until now have been &#8220;sitting on the fence&#8221; to accelerate their development plans for an omnichannel presence. This means not only starting to sell online — with all the complexities that this entails — but managing all marketing &amp; marketplace channels in an integrated manner. This also includes physical points of sale which, more than ever, must be supported with tools to broaden the reach and increase the flow of visitors.</p>
<p><strong>Below is an interview with the founder of Kipcast, Giovanni Guardalben.</strong></p>
<h3>The customer is the core of omnichannel paths</h3>
<p>Local inventory and eCommerce performance strategies are the core of <a href="https://kipcast.com">Kipcast</a>&#8216;s offering. The Italian-Canadian company was founded in 2006 with the aim of aggregating and distributing optimized web content to analysts, publishers, and product directories. Over time, data has been replaced by content. Today, Kipcast&#8217;s technology helps companies sell online using product-based marketing strategies and for physical retailers to promote local inventory online marketing approaches. These approaches, are the key to engaging consumers, attracting them to local stores, and retaining their loyalty.</p>
<h3>Campaign management, a boost for sales</h3>
<p>Kipcast provides retailers and brands with tools to improve the performance of their marketing campaigns and sales in three ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, with our feed management tool, which allows companies to market their products effectively using options like Facebook Dynamic Product Ads, Google Shopping, Online Comparison Sites, Affiliate Websites, and Retargeting and Remarketing Engines,” explained Giovanni Guardalben, Kipcast’s founder. “Secondly, through the integrated management of orders on third-party online stores and marketplaces, taking care of all integration activities for order processing, logistics, and fulfillment. Finally, by offering consultancy and technical support in the creation of marketing campaigns designed for effective local inventory-based campaigns.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-9165 size-full alignleft" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Giovanni-Guardalben.jpg" alt="giovanni-guardalben-kipcast" width="728" height="90" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Giovanni-Guardalben.jpg 728w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Giovanni-Guardalben-480x59.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 728px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kipcast offers two platforms: <br /><a href="https://highstreet.io/product-feed-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Highstreet.io</a> is a feed management solution used by over 200 retail, fashion, and consumer electronics brands, including Luisaviaroma, Timberland, Prada, Vans, and Unieuro. Clicktobrick.io, on the other hand, is a tool for managing local marketing campaigns on Google Ads, aimed at increasing the number of visitors to stores. Both are cloud-based and usable with a Software as a Service pricing model. The two Kipcast platforms are architecturally similar but designed to perform different tasks and benefit from the company’s expertise in data integration.</p>
<h3>eCommerce KPIs, the role of data integration</h3>
<p>Integrating an eCommerce platform with advertising platforms and marketplaces requires technical skills that are often lacking in marketing agencies or marketing departments. The biggest obstacles are data collection, data homogenization, and the synchronization of data.</p>
<p>This is where <a href="https://highstreet.io">Highstreet.io</a> comes in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our platform connects to our client’s backend to manage product feeds on one side and the order cycle, logistics, and fulfillment on the other. Highstreet.io simplifies the import of a product catalog by cleaning up the feeds, structuring them, and standardizing the feeds in different formats — API, XML, CSV, and JSON. As a result, Highstreet.io’s platform and support are essential for marketers dealing with increasingly complex data integration, which jeopardizes their eCommerce performance and campaign management.&#8221; explained Guardalben.</p>
<p>Data can be acquired directly from Highstreet.io by using APIs and the native connectivity of the platform with the customer&#8217;s eCommerce system. It can also be acquired through a master catalog or through the real-time acquisition of notifications of changes in the offer, which the customer communicates directly to Kipcast. The data is distributed by Highstreet.io to various marketing channels and marketplaces through appropriate format transformations and then updated in real-time, as needed.</p>
<p>The system is designed for the rapid onboarding of new customers, thanks to the increasingly intensive use of artificial intelligence algorithms. &#8220;Our Feed Complete approach includes a series of technologies that allow for the generation of rich digital content even in the absence of structured data,” noted Giovanni Guardalben. “This leads to significant time savings when publishing catalogs on different channels. We take care of everything; acquiring and unifying data from the eCommerce site and the company&#8217;s backend. We then integrate the client&#8217;s backend into our platform using a direct connection, which requires no additional development effort. The retailer is then able to manage Amazon orders directly with SAP or other major ERPs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kipcast&#8217;s services also extend to Automated Product Fulfillment Management. This includes order capture from the marketplace and transfers to the customer, the capture of order fulfillment status and shipping information from the customer, and the transfer of this information to the online merchant.</p>
<h3>One-click product listing campaigns</h3>
<p>Companies operating on marketplaces must know how to make the most of product data. Usually, those who start selling online start with an AdWords campaign, which is supported by a campaign budget aimed at appearing at the top of Google search results. These placements are ads with paid product cards that show a photo of the reference, a brief description of its main features, an indication of the price, and the name of the store. These ads are known as Product Listing Ads (PLA).</p>
<p>PLAs are essential in capturing the attention of someone conducting an online search for that product category and can, therefore, be considered a &#8220;quality&#8221; click, which offers a good chance to convert.</p>
<p>&#8220;To create effective PLAs, we develop data sets that are impeccable from an SEO point of view, with quality data that is always up to date, and with highly engaging and optimized content. It&#8217;s a particularly complex job that requires technical skills in data integration, content management, and SEO writing that virtually no company or agency has in-house,” says Guardalben. “Further complicating matters are PLA technical specifications and formats that change frequently. The risk, for those who don&#8217;t adapt quickly, is to see the efforts and investments committed to the online channel wasted. This is why we have begun to offer our consultation in this area, in particular for Google Shopping.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Highstreet.io platform is designed to optimize product data (attributes and variants) so that the offer is highlighted, ensuring the best sales performance. In addition, the use of different templates allows for the rapid modification of feeds, which must be changed often to take into account not only the changes in the availability of products in stock but also new promotions, maximizing the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns.</p>
<h3>Click to Brick to facilitate retail rebound</h3>
<p>Post-pandemic retail rebound, however, also involves rethinking the role of physical stores. An effective omnichannel strategy not only enhances online sales but also creates new experiences and shopping opportunities in physical stores by supporting them with promotions and localized online campaigns.</p>
<p>Kipcast’s Clicktobrick.io campaign management platform optimizes text search and displays campaigns in a Google Ads environment. This solution allows you to improve the effectiveness of the local inventory campaigns, which, in turn, increases visits to physical stores.</p>
<p>The efficient synchronization of local product data guarantees that only the products that are available in that store are advertised, with messages visible only to the people who are located around the store. &#8220;Kipcast is the Italian partner of reference for the development of Google Local Inventory Ads campaigns, the new way of making campaigns integrated with Google My Business, which aims to generate traffic to the point of sale,” concluded Giovanni Guardalben. “The most evident result is the increase in conversions, accompanied by a reduction in operating costs linked to the more effective management of local stock.&#8221; This is a very pressing issue in this re-opening phase [during the pandemic].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many brands and their agency partners, The North Face and PHD Media, continually strive to get a better ROI from their product listing campaigns. This goal may seem obvious but when it comes to adopting new approaches to optimizing performance, the truth is it’s not easy.</p>
<p>Google Shopping is constantly updating its platform and new data sources to boost campaign performance become available over time.</p>
<h3>Working Together to Achieve Better Product Listing Results</h3>
<p>The first step towards developing specialized feeds that improve our customer’s campaigns is to develop a close working relationship with both our brand and agency partners.</p>
<p><a href="https://highstreet.io/">Highstreet.io</a> has been working with The North Face as their Product Feed Management Solution for quite some time. Part of this solution involves <strong>creating a Performance Feed</strong> that collects The North Face’s sales data from their Google Analytics to automatically create and update a list of best-selling products, and assign a bestseller custom label in their Google Shopping Feed.</p>
<p>Because of our close working relationship with The North Face and their agency, PHD Media, we were able to collaborate on the details of adding a new data source within Google Merchant Center called the <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/9626903?hl=en">price competitiveness report</a>.</p>
<h3>What is Google Merchant Center’s Price Competitiveness Report?</h3>
<p>This report offers two ways to segment and view data:</p>
<ol>
<li>When you’re viewing data by category, brand, or product type, you can track how competitive you are in Shopping ads auctions over time.</li>
<li>When you’re viewing data by-product, you’ll see information on individual products for which a benchmark metric is available.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Performance Feed + Google Merchant Price Competitiveness Report</h3>
<p>By adding the data from Google&#8217;s price competitive report, we were able to identify and mark the best-selling products that were also priced competitively.</p>
<p>Why does it matter? The result gave PHD Media the ability to <strong>create targeted campaigns on a subset of high-converting products</strong> that are updated automatically <strong>based on price competitiveness and sales data &#8211;</strong> a search marketer’s dream.</p>
<p>What advertiser wouldn’t want a segmented group of products that had a higher likelihood of converting to sales based on their popularity and competitive price?</p>
<blockquote><p>“I would recommend working with Highstreet.io for product feed management. They were quick to accurately configure the feeds and they actively participated in discussions on how to construct the feed in a way that would give us the results we were looking for. It felt like a true partnership where our common goal was to provide The North Face the best Google Shopping results.” <strong>Andrew Griffiths &#8211; Senior Search &amp; Social Manager, Digital Solutions &#8211; PHD Global Business</strong></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Advertising products online seem straightforward. Simple enough at first, until you want to achieve more with your shopping campaigns.</p>
<p>In this post, you&#8217;ll discover the key factors to determine when you need to take the next step to a <strong>full-service data management platform. </strong>But first, let&#8217;s review what a Data Management Platform is and how it can benefit you and your business.</p>
<h2 class="entry-title">What is a Product Data Management Platform?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Feed Management Platform is a software platform used to collect and manage all your product data. This system allows you to have highly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">optimized information about your products, centralizing all those details into one file(product feed) to better promote your products across multiple channels, in different markets, and reach targeted audiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Full-Service Data Feed Management Platform helps you with all your </span><b>data management</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needs, from data feed creation, configuration, optimization, and synchronization, to customization.<br />
</span>Let&#8217;s dive into some of the reasons why and when you should consider a Full-Service Product Data Management Platform</p>
<h2>Promote Products in other Countries, Currencies &amp; Languages</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to advertise your products in other countries, languages, and currencies there are a few challenges you might be facing.</p>
<p>To customize campaigns for different markets, you want to create dedicated feeds for each specific channel and customize your campaigns for each market you are going to sell on.<br />
Here are some examples of <strong>scenarios that require separate feeds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to tie a promotion to a certain country and not have that promotion show up in your other feeds.</li>
<li>If you want to use dedicated promotions in certain countries and you don&#8217;t want the promotions showing up in other markets.</li>
<li>When your product data from the master source contains some data that is only in one language and you want to remove it for other countries.</li>
<li>Your inventory might change for different countries depending on where the merchandise is being stored.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you start advertising in more than one country and you’re creating multiple feeds for each channel in each country you need to be able to manage a large volume of feeds. This might not be that easy.</p>
<p>Here is where a <strong>full-service data management feed platform can help</strong>. The platform and service allow you to <strong>manage all your feeds, making sure they are all updated correctly as well as optimized for each country and channel.</strong></p>
<h3>Increase the Number of Products To Sell</h3>
<p>As your business grows so can your product inventory. If you find you have ongoing technical feed issues because of the volume of your products then it is time to look at a full-service data feed management platform.<br />
Some of the<strong> typical challenges brands and retailers have when they increase their product inventory</strong> can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product variants are mixed up when the data is pulled from the eCommerce platform. They need to be adjusted and reordered to match Google&#8217;s requirements.</li>
<li>The more products you sell the more likely your products will sell out. If your inventory displaying in your ads isn’t up-to-date because it’s taking too long to synchronize with the website then the channel you’re advertising on might stop showing your ads.</li>
<li>If you’re selling high volumes of products on your site the need for real-time synchronization of your products might be needed. You always want your website inventory to match the inventory displayed on other channels that promote your products.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re having these challenges then it might be<strong> time to start working with a product data feed management company</strong>. Keep reading to learn more.</p>
<h3>Increase the Number of Distribution Channels</h3>
<p>The more channels you advertise on the more technical issues you’ll have. Seriously, do you have that much time to dedicate to feed issues?</p>
<p>Nearly every distribution channel you use to promote your products has different feed specifications. This means the product data within each feed should be customized to the needs of that channel and follow channel requirements. If you’re promoting your products in 5 different channels that means 5 feeds times the number of countries you’re advertising in.</p>
<p>Some popular distribution channels include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comparison Shopping Websites &amp; Search Engine Marketing:</strong> Google Shopping, Bing Shopping, Nextag, Shopzilla &amp; PriceGrabber</li>
<li><strong>Social Commerce:</strong> <a href="https://highstreet.io/facebook-dynamic-product-ads/">Facebook Dynamic Product Ads</a>, Instagram Shoppable Posts</li>
<li><strong>Affiliate Networks:</strong> Rakuten/Linkshare, CJ, <a href="https://highstreet.io/join-awin-affiliate-program/">Awin</a></li>
<li><strong>Retargeting Networks:</strong> Criteo &amp; AdRoll</li>
<li><strong>On-Site Services/Tools:</strong> Site Search, Recommendation Engines &amp; Size Finders</li>
</ul>
<p>Feed requirements to promote your products across channels are constantly changing. We’ve provided only a few examples above but there are hundreds of options depending on which country you’re advertising in. For more details on available channels, take a look at the full list of <a href="https://highstreet.io/marketing-channels/">marketing channels</a> and <a href="https://highstreet.io/marketplace-channels/">marketplace channels</a> you can connect to</p>
<h2>Customize Your Product Data With the Right Platform</h2>
<p>Troubleshooting and customizing your feeds for the best outcomes can take up much time and resources. A Full-Service Data Management Feed Platform helps you save time on manual tasks by automatically displaying your products and effectively reaching the right customers on multiple channels.<br />
Here are some typical examples of customizations and data manipulations Highstreet.io takes care of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website scraping to get <strong>specific data that is not being captured in master feeds</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adding GTINs</strong> from an outside source to be included in the feeds: these codes might not be available in master feeds or eCommerce platforms</li>
<li><strong>Reconfiguration of Product Titles and Categories</strong> to follow a specific channel’s requirements, including important information customers are looking for</li>
<li><strong>Adding product promotion information</strong> at specific times of the year</li>
</ul>
<p>Time is money and leaving the technical details to a trusted feed management partner means you can focus on other important marketing matters.
