										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the car, on his way home from the office, an executive suddenly remembers his wife asking him to pick up milk. At the doctor’s office, a woman in the waiting room reads a recipe in a magazine and gets inspired. Just as his after-work basketball game wraps up, a young man realizes he has little left in the cupboard.</p>
<p>Although some grocery shopping begins with planning at home, many consumers decide to make a trip to their local store in the moment, while on the move. <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/3246303?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local search ads</a>, much like local inventory ads (LIAs), are increasingly the way they decide where they’ll go to buy their favorite foods.</p>
<h2>What are Local Search Ads?</h2>
<p>When consumers search for a term like “grocery store,” there are any number of brands that might show up in results based on the search engine optimization (SEO) quality of their content. In this case, however, consumers want the most relevant suggestions, which means identifying grocery stores nearby. This is where local search ads can help.</p>
<p>Using location extensions within Google Merchant Center (GMC), for example, local search ads ensure that Google will run the ads above more general search results and even provide directions to minimize the time spent traveling to get to a grocery store.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Local Search Ads</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-15588 size-full" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Benefits-of-local-search-ads.jpg" alt="Benefits of local search ads" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Benefits-of-local-search-ads.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Benefits-of-local-search-ads-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Consumers are becoming more thoughtful than ever before in where they grocery shop. This is in part due to rising food costs, but also because they know they can quickly compare multiple brands at once with a quick search on their smartphones. As a result, <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/8-trends-grocery-industry-2023/639547/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greater competition has been a rising trend across the grocery sector</a>.</p>
<p>Local search ads on Google Maps can make sense as a response to this trend because they focus on the convenience of shopping for groceries at the nearest possible store.</p>
<p>Other benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>A more effective use of your digital advertising budget:</b> While other marketing tactics could nurture customers over time, local searches are often tied to more immediate purchase intent. This can mean a greater return on investment (ROI) for pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns.</li>
<li><b></b><b>More data for analysis and insights</b>: Tracking the path to purchase from local searches to in-store visits can help you see opportunities to optimize your website and other aspects of the digital experience you’re delivering to potential customers.</li>
<li><b></b><b>Details that drive decisions:</b> Consumers don’t just need to know which stores operate in their neighborhood. They also want to ensure they don’t show up when a store has closed, or whether it offers more than one way to get the items they want. Local search ads on Google Maps provide plenty of room to include particulars such as store hours and whether they offer delivery or in-store pickup.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Google Local Search Ads vs. Local Inventory Ads</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-15597 size-full" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oil-newyork2-phone-2.jpg" alt="Google Local Search Ads vs. Local inventory Ads" width="750" height="854" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oil-newyork2-phone-2.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oil-newyork2-phone-2-480x547.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grocery stores aren’t limited to local advertising campaigns based on search ads alone.<a href="https://highstreet.io/local-inventory-ads-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Successful brands also take advantage of local inventory ads (LIAs)</a>, which provide even more granular specifics about a brand’s products to help customers shop.</p>
<p>Instead of a generic search for “grocery stores,” for example, consumers might be shopping with a special ingredient in mind. A Google LIA could highlight that ingredient – whether it’s a kind of bread, a sauce, or a cut of meat – to confirm it’s in stock at a nearby location.</p>
<p>This goes a step further than Google business ads that are based on a grocery store’s <a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Profile</a> (formerly Google My Business). Instead of simply verifying a business is operating and listing its store locations, a Google LIA lets you feature products that are part of an overall Google Shopping campaign by linking the Business Profile with GMC and Google Ads.</p>
<p>A Google LIA also requires having accurate, up-to-date data on your product availability, which is supported by a product feed management solution. This is why<a href="https://highstreet.io/customer-success-stories/carrefour-brings-greater-accuracy-to-local-inventory-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> leading grocery brands like Carrefour have worked with Highstreet.io</a> to help manage their LIAs.</p>
<h2>Best practices for running local campaigns as part of a successful marketing strategy</h2>
<p>A Google Local Inventory Ads can work hand-in-hand with Google Local Search Ads to provide the kind of immediate, comprehensive information consumers want and expect. Make sure you consider the following as you begin exploring further:</p>
<h3>How will seasonality influence customer needs?</h3>
<p>Grocery stores know it’s time to showcase turkeys in their stores as holidays like Christmas get closer, or to vegetable skewers when barbecue season arrives. Consumers may be increasing local searches amid these seasonal periods as their schedules get busier, so use the right ad tools to reach them.</p>
<h3>What will drive long-term customer loyalty?</h3>
<p>Customers will be grateful to find a local grocery store when they’re in a pinch, but they may go out of their way to return if they can get a good deal. Think about how you could use local search advertising to boost the effectiveness of discounts and other promotions.</p>
<h3>Where will the customer journey take people?</h3>
<p>Consumers may prefer to not only search online but buy that way too. Enabling e-commerce options provides greater flexibility and can be highlighted as part of local advertising campaigns. Don’t stop there, though: think through whether customers will shop locally because they want a shorter distance for shipping, or whether you should offer in-store or curbside pickup. If they come in-store, strive to offer personalized campaigns that can build a unique and emotional connection with your brand.</p>
<h2>Take the next step with local advertising campaigns</h2>
<p>If you haven’t already, set up your Google Business Profile so that it can be easily connected with GMC and you can begin leveraging location extensions in search ads.</p>
<p>Much like the products you’re advertising, meanwhile, your business is likely in a state of constant change. You can avoid the risk of outdated or incomplete details in your profile by connecting with a partner like Highstreet.io which specializes in<a href="https://highstreet.io/business-listing-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> business listing management</a>. This includes curating, optimizing, and distributing all the data necessary to rise in search rankings and gain more search traffic.</p>
<p>When it comes time to pair local search ads with a Google LIA, work with a partner like Highstreet.io to allow inventory data to be updated easily and consistently, while also taking away the manual effort that can otherwise put a strain on your resources.</p>
<p>Grocery stores are the ultimate example of the kind of local business consumers depend upon. Make their lives easier and <a href="https://highstreet.io/contact-us/">grow your business by connecting with Highstreet.io </a>to make the most of search advertising.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Setting the right marketing objectives is a critical part of positioning your company for success as a new year begins. Ideally, these should be SMART goals – those which are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. In that sense,<a href="https://highstreet.io/run-successful-local-inventory-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> enhancing your omnichannel marketing strategy using local inventory ads (LIAs)</a> may be the smartest goal of all.</p>
<p>Even amid ongoing economic turbulence and supply chain disruption, for example, it’s easy to see how<a href="https://highstreet.io/local-inventory-ads-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> using LIAs</a> aligns perfectly with the SMART goal framework:</p>
<h3>Specific</h3>
<p>Rather than run campaigns focused simply on the broadest possible reach, Google Shopping <b>Local inventory ads allow you to target specific products at the consumers who are searching within the vicinity of your physical locations.</b></p>
<h3>Measurable</h3>
<p>As retailers who have already worked with Highstreet.io to implement LIAs have learned, the <b>results of these campaigns can be directly attributed to critical marketing metrics</b> (more on that below).</p>
<h3>Achievable</h3>
<p>With a partner like Highstreet.io, LIAs can be set up and run without adding to the workload of marketing teams who already have enough on their plates. Using <b>product feed management to power LIA campaigns can reduce manual and repetitive tasks.</b></p>
<h3>Relevant</h3>
<p>LIAs are relevant to any retailer that wants to <b>increase revenues and lower their costs of acquiring customers</b>. As for shoppers, LIAs represents the most relevant marketing imaginable because they only see what’s in stock.</p>
<h3>Time-bound</h3>
<p>When you’ve<a href="https://highstreet.io/google-merchant-center-feed-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> optimized your product feeds for LIAs</a>, they can change as frequently as necessary to<b> ensure available inventory is always front and center in search results.</b></p>
<h2>Making the Most of Google Shopping Local Inventory Ads</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14475" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LIA-men-shoes-toronto.jpg" alt="LIA men shoes toronto" width="750" height="602" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LIA-men-shoes-toronto.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LIA-men-shoes-toronto-480x385.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a trusted Google partner, <a href="https://highstreet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Highstreet.io</a> has a proven track record in helping online sellers maximize their marketing budget and deliver increased value for their business.</p>
<p>No question that taking<a href="https://highstreet.io/merchant-hosted-local-storefront-attract-more-local-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a local approach to omnichannel marketing</a> is essential. According to recent research,<a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 81% of consumers used Google to evaluate local businesses in 2021</a>, compared with 63% the year before.</p>
<p>If Google Shopping Local inventory ads are new to you, here are three best practices to consider as you get started:</p>
<h3>1. Identify the metrics where LIAs can move the needle</h3>
<p>Ultimately, marketing is about enticing customers to make a purchase and encouraging them to come back again. LIAs allows you to analyze results at an even more granular level, however. While the metrics that matter can vary from one business to another, some of the common areas where LIAs have proved transformative include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average increase in online conversation rates</li>
<li>Increase in mobile sales</li>
<li>Increase in-store visits</li>
<li>Lower cost per store visit</li>
<li>Lift in in-store visits at a constant store visit rate</li>
<li>Lift in offline revenue from traffic driven by local inventory ads</li>
<li>Increase in return-on-ad-spend (ROAS)</li>
</ul>
<p>As 2023 begins, talk with your team about where you’ll want to focus in terms of monitoring marketing performance and talk to experts like Highstreet.io about how to act upon the data.</p>
<h3>2. Optimize marketing for the complete customer journey</h3>
<p>For some consumers, the path to purchase is pretty linear. They look for an item they want on Google, see a local inventory ad showcasing the product they want, then<a href="https://highstreet.io/local-inventory-ads-turn-online-browsers-into-in-store-shoppers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> visit a nearby store</a> to buy it.</p>
<p>In other cases, shoppers will place orders online and reserve items to be picked up later. Some consumers will be shopping on their smartphones while they’re already in a store, comparing pricing and selection among competing brands.</p>
<p>LIAs offer options to tailor your marketing based on all these journeys, and others. You can promote inventory that can be conveniently picked up on the same day, for instance, or “pickup later” items that will show up in search results with the specific date they’re available.</p>
<p>LIAs can also help guide customers toward their preferred fulfillment experiences, whether it’s buying online, pickup in-store (BOPIS), click-and-collect, and more.</p>
<h3>3. Build a Google Shopping Local Inventory Ads partnership to keep your business competitive</h3>
<p>LIAs have evolved considerably since they were first introduced, and Google continues to provide additional features and functionality.</p>
<p>In the past year, for example, the company has begun offering formats such as <b>navigational ads that are shown when drivers are using Google Maps</b>. “Similar Places” LIAs, meanwhile, can ensure your stores show up when consumers are looking for products at a competitor that has closed for the day.</p>
<p>The most valuable marketing partnership is therefore not limited to<a href="https://highstreet.io/how-to-create-a-google-local-inventory-products-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> providing a seamless process for setting up LIAs, onboarding, and offering support</a>. Instead, successful retailers work with Highstreet.io to explore new opportunities to fine-tune campaigns based on new formats, features, and the unique needs of each business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you’re visiting a new city for the first time and want to find the best restaurants, galleries, and shops, experienced travelers know what to do: ask a local.<br />
As long-time residents, the locals have learned how to spot amenities and attractions that reflect a city’s unique culture, which makes them experts in recommending products and experiences others will appreciate. <strong>Local online marketing</strong> that resonates with these tastemakers is a powerful way to <strong>help global brands deepen customer loyalty and accelerate their growth.</strong></p>
<p>As <em>Vogue Business</em> reported, some of the luxury world’s best-known fashion houses have used everything from pop-up shops to<a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/fashion/global-luxury-brands-balenciaga-prada-koche-explain-localised-marketing-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> limited-edition merchandise</a> to cater to local interests. Others have set up permanent physical locations that <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/retail/neighborhood-store-local-retail-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reposition their brands from mass-market merchants to an integral part of specific neighborhoods</a>.</p>
<p>This builds upon a long tradition of <a href="https://www.getmarvia.com/blog/12-examples-of-brands-with-great-local-marketing-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local advertising that connects with discerning consumers</a> through their language, their sports teams, or cultural celebrations.</p>
<h2>The Case For Selling Products Locally</h2>
<p>Local online marketing and<strong> selling products locally became an even greater priority</strong> in 2020, when lockdowns amid the early COVID-19 outbreak restricted many consumers from shopping with brands nearby.<br />
At the time, research from consulting firm Accenture found that 56% of consumers were shopping in neighborhood stores. The overwhelming majority (79%) said they were planning to continue this behavior in the long term.</p>
<p>The increased reports of floods, forest fires, and other impacts of global warming are also influencing shoppers’ decision-making. Data from Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram found that “sustainable fashion” is nearly 12 times more likely to be discussed on Instagram than any other topic.</p>
<p>As shopping locally becomes the norm, global brands may need to combine their marketing activities with changes in where they source materials and how they manufacture goods to align with their customers’ values. This will not be without its challenges, but with the right strategy, it opens the door for deeper, more personalized relationships.</p>
<h2>Local Online Advertising: Challenges And Strategies To Consider</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-12844 aligncenter" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/local-strategy.jpg" alt="online local advertising" width="750" height="460" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/local-strategy.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/local-strategy-480x294.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Global brands that use local advertising need to market themselves to consumers in specific locales in a way that’s both authentic and credible. In other words, the ads they create or tactics they use need to demonstrate a genuine knowledge of, and interest in, the characteristics of specific communities.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to begin selling products locally, keep the following principles in mind:</p>
<h3>1. Being present everywhere in the omnichannel journey</h3>
<p>A 2022 survey of consumers found that <a href="https://www.theretailbulletin.com/retail-solutions/the-rise-of-local-marketing-in-retail-2022-12-04-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75% of people who use their mobile phone to make a local search end up visiting a store within 24 hours</a>. For the quarter who choose to shop locally online, the customer journey needs to be just as simple. That means making it easy to find products on digital storefronts and displaying them with local pricing and currency information.</p>
<p>Remember that customers may also turn to brands with a local presence when browsing on social media or other channels. The path to purchase should always be as smooth as possible.</p>
<h3>2. Ensuring every local brand promise is kept</h3>
<p>If local advertising for a limited-edition product drives interest among niche clientele, they will have expectations that product inventories are accurate and up to date long before they walk through the door. The same research found that 58% of consumers who found incorrect information on a brand’s website would leave and not give them a second chance.</p>
<p>This is why smart global brands use local inventory ad campaigns. By showcasing products that appeal to them – and are ready to be picked up or shipped – they can have confidence they’re delivering a positive customer experience. This, in turn, means customers will have good things to say about a brand to their friends, family, and visitors. Another study showed that nearly 80% of local businesses believe their <a href="https://www.podium.com/guides/2022-local-business-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reputation is their greatest differentiator.</a></p>
<h3>3. Reinforcing local inventory ads with brand visibility</h3>
<p>Local online marketing works best when it resonates with the lived experience of its target audience. Beyond the pop-up shops and other examples mentioned above, there are plenty of<strong> local advertising opportunities</strong> global brands could pursue. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating products or <strong>merchandise tie-ins that connect with a locale’s history</strong> or heritage, such as images that include an element from a national flag, an iconic building, or local cuisine.</li>
<li><strong>Sponsoring a local charitable initiative</strong>, such as a food bank, that speaks to a locale’s unique needs</li>
<li><strong>Collaborating with local suppliers</strong> or artisans to boost the fortunes of an entire community</li>
<li><strong>Develop ads featuring the stories of local people</strong> that reflect their aspirations and milestones</li>
</ul>
<p>When this is done well, brands can make a positive impression on consumers – one which can be<strong> reinforced by the local inventory ads</strong> they see later.</p>
<h2>Next steps: Working with an experienced Local Online Marketing Partner</h2>
<p>The way forward will have brands taking a two-pronged approach: marketing to the world at large but also honing on local communities that represent significant sources of potential growth. It may require rethinking how marketing budgets are allocated, the advertising content that is created, and even the people they hire.</p>
<p>In such a fast-changing industry, we believe<strong> innovation is the key to success</strong>. That’s why you should consider incorporating the right technology into the process.</p>
<p>An effective product feed management solution, for example, <strong>ensures customers are never disappointed.</strong> That’s because this technology allows you to organize all your product data in one place <a href="https://highstreet.io/local-inventory-ads-turn-online-browsers-into-in-store-shoppers/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=local-inventory-ads-turn-online-browsers-into-in-store-shoppers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">while running local inventory ads</a> that cover a broader range of items within a specific radius.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you&#8217;re searching for the latest fashion trends, your favorite pair of running shoes, or simply looking to buy yourself that bag you’ve always wanted, it all comes down to researching online. And what if the product you were looking for was available at a nearby store, wouldn’t you consider buying it right away?</p>
<p>Your customers are no different. When they’re searching for products, they go online to find them. And, if the product is available within reach of their location, thus they can get it right away, and they will make that purchase.</p>
<p>Search marketing is usually focused on driving traffic to websites &amp; online sales, so it is not easy for marketers and retailers to attract customers to their brick-and-mortar stores.<br />
In the world of advertising, there are many solutions to better grab users&#8217; attention and bring them to your website &#8211; but how do you attract people online, and turn them into in-store shoppers?</p>
<p>In this post you will learn about users&#8217; local search intent, and how local online advertising can help you better meet customer expectations, boost foot traffic to your store and increase sales.</p>
<h2>The importance of Local Online Advertising</h2>
<p>Almost half of Google searches showed local intent with a third of consumers checking local products and local businesses online every day, with mobile queries prevailing. According to Forbes<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/08/11/five-tips-for-local-search-in-2020/?sh=7651ef993d39" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> local search helps people find what they need when they need it</a>.</p>
<p>Local search has also the greatest potential to connect consumers with your products and services better than any other marketing medium.<br />
It&#8217;s all about the intent to buy. So, when people perform a local search, there is typically a much higher intent to purchase. Therefore, a higher conversion rate, as searched products are available within reach of the user&#8217;s current location.</p>
<p>Consumers are searching for locally available products everywhere, on every device, and at every point in the purchase journey. If we look at mobile users, the likelihood of local searches resulting in an in-store visit increases by 35%.</p>

<p>This is why having your products available across Google properties on Google search and Google Display it’s so important.<br />
Remember, you must make sure your product availability, address, location, and directions appear in your ads across smartphones and computers/tablets to truly succeed in your local advertising.<br />

<h2>How Local Online Advertising Works</h2>
<p>Local Online Advertising specifically centers around a local business or local store chain and targets potential customers in a physical store’s area.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12367" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/How-Local-Online-Advertising-Works.jpg" alt="How Local Online Advertising Works" width="750" height="464" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/How-Local-Online-Advertising-Works.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/How-Local-Online-Advertising-Works-480x297.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By showing people products that are at hand in their location, they will likely become more attracted to you and your products, and take a step into your store to purchase as it’s immediately available within their reach. The takeaways? Consumers would buy in-store instead of online knowing they are closer to the store, and that they can get the product quickly.</p>
<p>This type of marketing can be very effective for brands and retailers who want to increase awareness and effectively advertise their products and availability, bringing more qualified customers into in-store purchasing. Let’s take a look at how advertising locally available products within a specific area user are searching, can help you stand out from your competitors and gain more qualified in-store traffic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ask your customers how often they enjoy waiting in line at a physical store and the most likely answer is ”Never.” The same is probably true if you ask them what it feels like to be put on hold when they call in to ask basic questions, such as whether the product they’re looking for is in stock or not.</p>
<p>Worst of all is when they place an online order and find themselves clicking the “order status” button on their digital receipt over and over again, wondering if shipping delays are getting between them and what they bought.</p>
<p>As more people turn to online channels as a key part of their shopping experience, product availability, and proximity are becoming what defines success in almost every kind of business.<br />
This is why understanding the difference between local text ads and Google LIA — and how to use them — is an essential part of your e-commerce strategy.</p>
<h2>Why Thinking Global But Acting Local Is More Important Than Ever</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10955" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Harness-the-Power-01.jpg" alt="How To Harness the Power Of Local Text Ads And Local Inventory Ads In The Emerging ‘Neighborhood Economy’" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>As eMarketer recently reported,<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/3-new-things-retail-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> e-commerce sales are expected to continue double-digit growth</a> in the U.S. alone to almost 18 percent in 2021 and will make up an estimated 20 percent of all retail sales by 2024.</p>
<p>The explosion of online shopping makes it easier to overlook an even more important retail transformation. While the Internet provides global reach for even the smallest businesses, customer behavior is creating what we might call a “neighborhood economy,” where the ability to meet customers where they are is the ultimate competitive differentiator.</p>
<p>As proof, consider that <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-to-win-local-search/416837/%23close" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local search has become the second most important channel</a> after organic search, according to a recent article in the <i>Search Engine Journal</i>.</p>
<p>This makes intuitive sense: Customers may start their research by looking broadly on Google for the products that interest them, but their buying decision will largely be driven by the convenience and speed of the retailer they choose.</p>
<h2>How Local Text Ads Work</h2>
<p>This is where local text ads in Google Ads campaigns provide a way to help streamline the experience for potential customers. By using location-targeted campaigns whose ad groups are used to configure local keywords and local ads, local text ads answer an urgent question:</p>
<p><strong><i>“Where are [luxury designer jackets] near me?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Local text ads can drive conversions with only a headline, a display URL, and a brief description.<br />
Even within those creative constraints, it’s possible to convey a unique selling proposition in a way that immediately builds credibility.<br />
Think of someone who’s looking for ethically produced cashmere sweaters. When they search on Google, they might see an ad like the fictitious one below before they even scroll down to see the organic results:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Cashmere wool sweaters with sustainability in mind</strong><br />
www.planetfriendlycashmere.com<br />
<i>Read reviews from our more than 1,000 satisfied customers and explore our extensive range of ethically sourced and produced cashmere wool sweaters. We’re available 24/7 to answer all your questions</i></p>
<h2>Google LIA at a glance</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10957" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Harness-the-Power-02.jpg" alt="How To Harness the Power Of Local Text Ads And Local Inventory Ads In The Emerging ‘Neighborhood Economy’" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>As an extension of Google Ads campaigns, Local Inventory Ads are based on Google Merchant Center, and a linked Google My Business account.</p>
<p>Here are a few other important details that differentiate Google LIA from local text ads:</p>
<ul>
<li>While local text ads can be used to promote cars, travel services, and almost anything else that Google Ads supports, local inventory focuses on selected categories. These include apparel, accessories, and many other retail products.</li>
<li>Google LIAs are also managed by Google, which assigns areas and location keywords using data from a linked Google My Business account.</li>
<li>Consumers might land on local inventory ads when they enter a search on Google like, “designer handbags near me,” or “buy pencil skirts in [city or town].”</li>
<li>Beyond text, Google LIAs allow retailers to feature images of their product as well as the price or other details such as measurements.</li>
</ul>
<p>When consumers click through, local inventory ads also act as digital storefronts by answering all the other frequently asked questions (FAQs) that run through customers’ minds. The ad will tell them exactly how far away a store location is, for instance, hours of operation, and more details about the product.</p>
<h2>Why a Local-First Approach to the Customer Journey Matters</h2>
<p>Customers may continue to randomly visit stores to see if a product is available, but increased concerns around safety protocols and simply the time they potentially waste mean they’re increasingly likely to begin their search online.</p>
<p>Based on what they learn from local text ads or local inventory ads, consumers can arm themselves with information to take the next step in their journey.</p>
<p>For some, this might include making an in-person visit, but not necessarily in the store environment. They might order online for curbside delivery instead.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10961" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Harness-the-Power-03.jpg" alt="How To Harness the Power Of Local Text Ads And Local Inventory Ads In The Emerging ‘Neighborhood Economy’" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>Local text and local inventory ads aren’t just great marketing tools. They are also ways to ensure customers don’t get frustrated or disappointed in their search and provide just enough details to offer value and guide customers to the right purchases.<br />
This helps businesses create the same kind of trusted relationships that people have always had with their favorite neighborhood shops.</p>
<p>Product feed management technology offers an ability to enhance the use of Google LIAs by optimizing the journey between marketing, sales, and beyond. <a href="https://highstreet.io/product-feed-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Explore what the future of your e-commerce experience could look like</a>, and feel free to contact us to learn more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to attracting local customers to brick-and-mortar stores, the competition is fierce. Especially when more shoppers are starting their research online.<br />
Studies have shown that <a href="https://seotribunal.com/blog/stats-to-understand-seo/#local-seo-facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the vast majority of people (around 97%) find out about local businesses on the Internet</a>.</p>
<p>Considering that local customers are most likely to visit your physical shop, it makes sense to focus on attracting these clients to your store location as they are browsing online. So why not give it a try?</p>
<h2>The Value of Local Inventory Ads</h2>
<p>Local Inventory Ads (Liasisre online ads that appear after you search for a product on Google. They display local products and, subsequently, your physical storefront, providing potential customers with all the details to help them move forward in their purchasing journey towards your stores.</p>
<p>There are two options of landing pages for this ad type:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Merchant-Hosted Local Storefront (MHLSF) page</li>
<li>A generic Google-managed page</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7178526?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merchant-Hosted Local Storefront</a> (MHLSF) pages improve shoppers’ experience with Local Inventory Ads by offering more information and purchasing options for users, helping you to increase in-store traffic and sales.</p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into the two types of MHLSF options available:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Basic MHLSFs</b> lead visitors to a product’s landing page, where they can select and purchase from a store of their choice that offers the item. The ad notates the price and availability of the product and allows for local pickup.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Full MHLSFs</b>, by contrast, lead to a product’s landing page for a specific store which includes the customized branding, store name, store location, local product price, related products, and a map of how to get to the store, and different purchasing options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Full MHLSF option for your local advertising gives you more control over directing shoppers to your branded landing page. Also, consumer behavior can be tracked and campaigns can be adjusted based on performance.</p>
<h2>Product Landing Page Requirements For Full MHLSF Pages</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10655 size-large" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ACME-map1-1024x546.png" alt="" width="1024" height="546" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ACME-map1-1024x546.png 1024w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ACME-map1-980x522.png 980w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ACME-map1-480x256.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>Your LIA Merchant Hosted Pages must be specific to your storefront and be compatible with various devices, from desktop to mobile.</p>
<p>The mandatory elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>The essentials</b>: Address, local price, and availability must be visible upon first hitting the page. If your business has multiple locations, have all this information present upon selecting a specific location. The local availability point is crucial and should have the same prominence as the option to purchase the product online.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Accurate pricing: </b>The local price must match the one you applied to your local inventory feed. If you’re only going to show the online price, the local price for that specific location must be the same.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Accurate availability: </b>Likewise, your actual in-store inventory availability must match the records in your Google My Business account. (You don’t want to provide a product landing page for an item that is out of stock.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few optional additions to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other store details like directions, contact information, and opening hours</li>
<li>A selection of similar products in your store</li>
<li>The ways to purchase items, such as through in-store pickup</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10657 size-large" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ACME-map5-1024x545.png" alt="" width="1024" height="545" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ACME-map5-1024x545.png 1024w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ACME-map5-980x521.png 980w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ACME-map5-480x255.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>For Google’s Search Engine to properly crawl your landing pages to check for accuracy and potential issues, we recommend you follow Google’s <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7353427" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structured data markup requirements</a>.</p>
<h2>Full MHLSF Pages Feed Requirements</h2>
<p>If you’re working with local product feeds you will have to add specific attributes to your feed like:</p>
<ul>
<li>[link_template], including a [store_code].</li>
<li>Other parameters like [mobile_link_template] work well if you’re optimizing for mobile devices and [ads_redirect] for URL tracking parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go through a brief rundown of the attributes needed for eCommerce stores.</p>
<p>Every product needs the [title], [description], [id], and [image_link] tags. [gtin] is recommended heavily and mandatory if the product manufacturer specifies one. New products require the [brand] attribute, while used or refurbished ones need [condition] specified.</p>
<p>For <b>companies operating in the EU</b>, energy efficiency attributes are needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>[energy_efficiency_class]</li>
<li>[min_energy_efficiency_class], and [max_energy_efficiency_class]</li>
</ul>
<p>Other <b>local regulations </b>sometimes require:</p>
<ul>
<li>[unit_pricing_measure] and [unit_pricing_base_measure] to complement the usual [price] and [sale_price] attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your <b>store offers local pickup options</b>, think about using the relevant attributes as well. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>[pickup_method]</li>
<li>[pickup_SLA]</li>
<li>[pickup_link_template]</li>
<li>[mobile_pickup_link_template]</li>
</ul>
<p>For <b>products not sold in stores</b>, use [excluded_destination], as it hides certain items from your online product feed.</p>
<p>Consult with <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/3061198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s official documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Local Inventory Ads can help you run successful campaigns. If you are already running Google Shopping ads then you are one step closer to <a href="https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/guides/how-tos/lia/get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener">setting up Local Inventory Ads.</a><br />In addition to your Google Merchant Center product feed, you will need to create three feeds:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Google My Business Store Feed</li>
<li>a Local Inventory Feed</li>
<li>a Local Product Feed</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not running Google Shopping ads you need to create four product data feeds. <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9808" title="Google Local Inventory Ads (LIAs)" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-26-at-9.01.34-AM-1024x329.png" alt="Google Local Inventory Ads (LIAs)" width="719" height="231" /></p>
<p>With all of this information connected, customers can find in-stock product information, pick-up details, as well as your store’s location, contact information, address, and hours of operation.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2>5 Must-Know Google LIA Optimization Tips</h2>
<p>Now that you&#8217;re running Local Inventory Campaigns and seeing how they can benefit your in-store sales, it&#8217;s time to differentiate your ads and shopping experience from your competitors.<br />Check out these optimization tips to get your products to stand out, and help your customers find what they are looking for, faster and easier.</p>
<h3><strong>1.</strong> <strong> Use the Pick-up Today&#8221;</strong> <strong>option </strong></h3>
<p>Promote items in stock at your local store with the &#8220;Pick-up Today&#8221; option. Use the following attribute values in your local products inventory feed:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>availability: “in stock” ○ pickup_method: “buy”</li>
<li>pickup_sla: “same day” or “next day”</li>
<li>Add the attribute “pickup_price” in your local inventory feed to specify your distinct pickup prices. If your pickup price is the same as your national price, use the price attribute in the Local Products feed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10006 size-large" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-pick-up-today-2-1024x546.jpg" alt="lia-pick-up-today" width="1024" height="546" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-pick-up-today-2-980x523.jpg 980w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-pick-up-today-2-480x256.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>2. Use the Pick-up Later&#8221; option</strong></h3>
<p>For out-of-stock items or if you don’t know the exact in-store inventory at a local store, use the &#8220;<strong>Pickup later&#8221;</strong> option. You can ship them to the local store for a shopper to pick up.<br />Use the following attribute values in your local product inventory feed:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>
<p class="p1">availability: “out of stock”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1">pickup_method: “ship to store”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1">pickup_sla: choose one of the following values 1-day, 2-day, 3-day, 4-day, 5-day, 6-day, 7-day, multi-week</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-10007 size-large aligncenter" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-pick-up-later-1-1024x546.jpg" alt="lia-pick-up-later" width="1024" height="546" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-pick-up-later-1-980x523.jpg 980w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-pick-up-later-1-480x256.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>3. Bid higher for shoppers closer to your store</strong></h3>
<p>Use the location extension bid modifiers to increase bids for shoppers close to your stores.</p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-10010 size-full aligncenter" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-bidding-1.jpg" alt="lia-bidding" width="750" height="400" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-bidding-1.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-bidding-1-480x256.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>4. Increase bids when stores are open</strong></h3>
<p>Ensure all hours are in blue. Avoid turning off ads outside store hours so shoppers can always find your products.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-10011 size-full aligncenter" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-campaigns.jpg" alt="lia-campaigns" width="750" height="400" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-campaigns.jpg 750w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-campaigns-480x256.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><strong>5. Regularly update sale items</strong> i<strong>n your Local Product Feed</strong></h3>
<p>Your in-store sales may be different than your eCommerce sales: Remember to update your local inventory product feed with current sales.  And, when the sale is over, don&#8217;t forget to remove the sale price from your feed!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-9997 size-large aligncenter" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-sale-item-1024x546.jpg" alt="lia-sale-item" width="1024" height="546" srcset="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-sale-item-980x523.jpg 980w, https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-sale-item-480x256.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div>
			</div><div id="integrated" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Another way you can differentiate your Local Inventory Campaigns is by creating landing pages for each product available in-store.<br />Most merchants will either use Google&#8217;s LIA landing page or the existing product page on their website that has an in-store buying option. But, these two types of pages don&#8217;t provide the user with a rich experience that meets all of their needs.</p>
<p>As a third alternative, you can provide a richer online user experience that is directly relevant to both the products and the location of the shopper. How?<br /><a href="https://highstreet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Highstreet.io</a> has designed and implemented <strong>dynamically generated landing pages</strong> that are directly relevant to both the products and the location of the physical selling points.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9983" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lia-custom-landing-page-1024x481.jpg" alt="Dynamically generated landing pages" width="781" height="367" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9989" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LIA-Customimized-Product-Page-1024x602.jpg" alt="LIA Customimized Product Page" width="784" height="461" /></p>
<p>This <strong>enhanced product page</strong> displays side-by-side a product data sheet (one or more products, with a detailed view for a title, a picture, the price, product variants, related products, sale price, and the availability of the product in the displayed store).</p>
<p>Included in this page template, you&#8217;ll get a <strong>customizable widget</strong> with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of the store</li>
<li>Main address and contact information such as phone, website, opening hours, etc.</li>
<li>Google map of where the product is available in-store</li>
</ul>
<p>Start optimizing your data feeds to <strong>differentiate your campaigns from competitors</strong>. Find out more about Highstreet.io product feed management Local Inventory Ads service. </p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Online Advertising has evolved and marketers around the globe are facing many challenges when it comes to promoting products online and offline. Things like targeting the right audience and driving relevant traffic to your website as well as to your store can sometimes be difficult to achieve. Also, you might get your products lost in the volume of offerings, especially when users are searching for similar products at a nearby location.</p>
<p>Large retailers have to showcase their stores if they want to reach more customers at the local level and allow them to fully experience their products. After all, people still crave the instant gratification of purchasing in-store.</p>
<p>Even if they intend to visit a local store, consumers often start their purchase journey online as they are searching for products and services. That’s where you need to be, to grab their attention at the right time,  and become part of their mindset, exactly when they’re looking to get the necessary information to pursue their purchase.</p>
<p>To refine your customer’s in-store path to purchase journey, Google has further improved features of Local Inventory Ads since its launch in 2014.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at what Google LIAs are to truly understand all you need to know about this powerful marketing solution and get you started with creating successful Local Inventory Ads.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you click on the ad you’ll be directed to a landing page that includes more information about the product, where to buy it, and how to get there. There is a big emphasis on the mobile search experience. The landing pages have a clean and intuitive display of related products nearby with all the information the user needs to find what they are looking for in-store.</p>
<p>Some of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Shopping listing that includes the distance to a local store</li>
<li>Store Landing Page for the product which could include:
<ul>
<li>the language “in stock nearby at ” with the map embedded in the listing</li>
<li>call button</li>
<li>link to directions</li>
<li>link to their website</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Local Store pages with a map and items that are available at that store</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Google Local Inventory Ads (LIA) click share also continues to rise for those participating in the program. On desktop, LIA generated 7 percent of clicks, up from just 1 percent a year ago. Mobile LIA clicks accounted for 15 percent of clicks, up slightly from 14 percent the previous year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As more countries become eligible to use Google Local Inventory Ads people searching for products online can more easily find in-stock items near them without wasting time going to the store just to find out the item is out of stock.</p>
<h2>The Google Local Inventory Ad (LIA) experience</h2>

<h2>Is Your Country Eligible to use Google Local Inventory Ads (LIAs)?</h2>

<p>If you are a retailer and <strong>you see your country in the list below</strong> then you can start building your local feed using the steps in this post.</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia,</li>
<li>Austria</li>
<li>Brazil</li>
<li>Canada</li>
<li>Denmark</li>
<li>France</li>
<li>Germany</li>

</ul>
<h2>How to Create a Local Product Feed</h2>
<p>Google describes what a <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7022397?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7023401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Product Feed</a> is in the following manner:</p>
<p><strong>A local product feed is a list of all of the products that you sell in your local stores with attributes that describe the products.</strong> Some attributes are required for all items, some are required for certain types of items, and others are recommended.</p>
<p>Note: Not providing a required attribute may prevent that particular item from showing up in results, and not providing recommended attributes may impact the ad’s performance.</p>
<h3>Feed Format</h3>
<p>Highstreet.io follows Google’s best practice by using one of the following file formats to synchronize your local products:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/160567" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a delimited text file</a> (Google recommends this technique)</li>
<li>XML file</li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/v2/reference/v2/products">API</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>How the Feed Works</h3>
<p>Google uses your local product feed as the authoritative source of your in-store product information. Shoppers will see the details of your products in your ad after they’ve done a Google product search. The ad that is served pulls product information from your feed for the store/s in the closest proximity to where the online search was made. When they click on the ad the user will land on a Google-hosted page for your local store.</p>
<h3>Local Product Feed Attributes</h3>
<p>The following <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7022397?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7023401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feed attributes</a> display in-store product information in your ads. These attributes should be included in the corresponding fields within your feed.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you&#8217;re missing one or more of the following product data items you should source the data to create a complete product feed.</p>
<p><b>General Products: Google Local Inventory Ads Feed Attributes </b></p>
<ul>
<li>item_id &#8211; if already using an online products feed we recommend matching this <strong>itemId</strong> to the value you use for the <strong>Id</strong></li>
<li>attribute</li>
<li>title</li>
<li>description</li>
<li>image_link</li>
<li>condition &#8211; use &#8220;new, used or refurbished&#8221; as values</li>
<li>gtin</li>
<li>brand</li>
<li>google_product_category &#8211; Use an <strong>MPN</strong> number and if the GTIN isn&#8217;t available <strong>MPN + brand</strong> is required</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Develop a Local Product Inventory Feed</h2>
<p>Similar to creating a Local Product Feed, a Product Inventory Feed includes additional attributes that are specific to the stock information of the local store.</p>
<h3>Feed Format</h3>
<p>The difference between a Local Product Feed and a Product Inventory Feed is that you cannot use an XML feed for your Inventory Feed.</p>
<p><strong>There are only 2 options:</strong> a <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/160567" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delimited text file</a>, or an <a href="https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/v2/reference/v2/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API</a>.</p>
<h3>Local Product Feed Inventory &amp; Ad Attributes</h3>
<p><a href="https://Highstreet.io">Highstreet.io</a> has found if you synchronize your product feed with Google frequently, the customer will see the most current inventory, prices, and appropriate information from the last update.</p>
<p>Google recommends the following attributes be included in your <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7023001?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7023401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Inventory Feed</a> and we pulled the <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7023001?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7023401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google sample feed</a> below to show the difference between required and optional fields you can include.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Attributes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Itemid</li>
<li>Store code</li>
<li>Quantity</li>
<li>Price</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sample Local Product Feed Inventory Attributes</strong></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-5476 alignnone size-full" src="https://highstreet.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sample-Local-Product-Attributes-Incremental-Feeds.png" alt="" width="895" height="240" /></h3>
<h3>Incremental Feeds</h3>
<p>Highstreet.io uses incremental feeds for many of our clients to advertise their products online. We highly recommend you use this process for synchronizing your local store inventory including price and quantity as this information changes quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Local Product Inventory Feed Options</strong><br />1. Local product inventory &#8211; All product data is submitted daily at a scheduled time.<br />2. Local product inventory update &#8211; Product data is submitted at various times throughout the day. Only product data that has changed will be updated in the feed.</p>
<h2>Feed Registration and Feed Upload</h2>
<p>If you are submitting a feed for the first time to Google Merchant Center follow <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7023001?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7023401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these steps from Google to register your feed or submit your local product inventory through an API</a>. Once you’ve registered your feed, go to Google Merchant Center to upload it.  To find all the <a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/1219255" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steps required to schedule your feed upload</a> go to Google Merchant Center.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you a retailer with one or multiple brick-and-mortar locations and an online store? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wondering how you can leverage the advertising tactics you’re using on the web to </span><b>drive more customers in-store</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To drive online demand for in-store purchases, you want to take advantage of platforms and technologies to help you deliver local ads to potential customers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies like Macy’s, Argos, Pottery Barn, Target, and many other retailers are reaping the benefits of Local Inventory Marketing</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this post, you will </span><b>learn how to get in-store sales from local online ads by</b>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Synchronizing your inventory and product data in real-time with ad platforms</li>
<li>Tracking your in-store inventory to be used for online advertising</li>
<li>Targeting your customers online and sending them in-store</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-2946"></span></p>
<h2>Local Inventory Marketing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local Inventory Marketing is the process of promoting your products and showcasing store information to nearby potential buyers that are searching for products and services like yours across Google.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few years, Google and Facebook recognized that local businesses needed new advertising options to convert customers from online to in-store. </span>They have been the drivers to expand Local Inventory Marketing in a previously unthinkable way.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why It’s important to get your in-store product catalog synchronized with Google and Facebook to serve local ads, to truly succeed in your marketing strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are 3 different ad types that allow you to get your products in front of potential customers:</span></p>
<h3>1. Google Local Inventory Ads (LIAs)</h3>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/3057972?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Local Inventory Ads</a> are an excellent way to connect your customer’s path to purchase from online to offline. Your customers are currently researching your products online so why not give them everything they need to pick up the product in-store?</p>
<p>In the example below, you can see a typical customer brand search that leads the user to the product they were looking for from a Google Local Inventory Ad. After clicking on the product ad, all of the relevant product inventory and location information is listed. A shopper can also find alternate locations with inventory details by clicking on “See other locations”.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Highstreet.io connects your local inventory to your Google Local Inventory Ads (LIAs) to ensure you always have the most up-to-date stock in your ads at all times.</em></p></blockquote>
<h5> Google Local Inventory Ad User Experience</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial Local Search in Google: Samsonite New York City</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clicked on Macy’s Result and landed on Macy’s Google Shopping Local Listing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clicked on “See other locations” to see if the product was in stock at another store.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Google AdWords Local Search Text Campaigns</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your country doesn’t have access to Google Local Inventory Ads, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">another way to move your user&#8217;s traffic from online to in-store is through Local Search Text Ads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the features are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Local Targeting with Ad Extensions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Create AdWords Text Ads Automatically Based on Feed Data</strong></li>
<li><strong>Create Dynamic Landing Pages with Feed Data</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3></h3>
<h3>3. Facebook Dynamic Ads using Local Audiences</h3>
<p>In 2016 Facebook expanded its Dynamic Product Ads to drive not only online sales but in-store sales with a product called “Dynamic Ads for Retail”. Facebook states that its ads include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local availability:</strong> An availability indicator on the ad shows people that a product is available at a store near them, and the store locator makes it easy for people to get directions.</li>
<li><strong>Product summaries:</strong> Advertisers can use Facebook-hosted product summaries to give potential shoppers the information they need without leaving the Facebook app.</li>
<li><strong>Different actions:</strong> Product summaries include ways for people to take actions like contacting the nearest store, buying online, or saving the product for future reference.</li>
<li><strong>Similar products:</strong> Similar products available at the nearest store are featured so people can browse the aisles right from their phones.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><em>Highstreet.io synchronizes your e-commerce product data feed with Facebook to offer real-time local availability and up-to-date product information to target people in areas that are closest to your location.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>How do Retailers start using Local Inventory Marketing?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to get your in-store product data to feed synchronized with Google and Facebook to provide a lasting impression on your customers. If you are marketing out-of-stock items or out-of-date brands or product information, your customers won’t trust you and your marketing</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how can you keep track of your store&#8217;s inventory without going crazy? The answer is RFID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RFID stands for </span><b>Radio Frequency Identification</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It refers to small electronic devices that contain a small chip and an antenna. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RFID device works similarly to a barcode on the back of a credit card. It provides a unique identifier for an object and can be scanned to pull the correct information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retailers are using RFID technology to lower shrinkage, synchronize inventory to cloud platforms and connect bricks-and-mortar data in one single stock. They are also looking at RFID technology to support their </span><b>Local Inventory Marketing Campaigns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Working with a reputable Product Feed Management company with Local Real-time Inventory Marketing experience will help to keep your product inventory and content up-to-date.</p>
<p><b>Some RFID Suppliers include:</b></p>
