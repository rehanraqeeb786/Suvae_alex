They\u2019re so relevant to your interests and aspirations you welcome the value they provide.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike traditional banner ads and pop-ups that consumers might scroll past on a website, Google Ad campaigns have proven effective in helping brands show up in the right place at the right time.<\/p>\n<p>When someone types into its search engine, for example, they\u2019re hoping to find a list of links that will take them where they want to go. Google Ad campaigns go beyond these basic search results by showcasing brands that relate to each query. If you\u2019re serious about selling online, they\u2019re a critical tool.<\/p>\n<h2>Google Ads: What they are and how campaigns work<\/h2>\n<p>Originally launched as Google AdWords, Google Ads is the search engine company\u2019s platform for powering online advertising across its flagship site, partner sites and YouTube. It offers ads in a variety of formats depending on a brand\u2019s needs such as text, video, display and banner ads.<\/p>\n<p>Google also offers some proprietary options such as Google Shopping Ads, Performance Max ads and Responsive Search ads.<\/p>\n<p>Launching Google Ad campaigns requires bidding for placement based on keywords and the search volume they get, when the ads will run and the expected reach.<\/p>\n<p>Before getting into the details of bidding and running your ads, however, you\u2019ll have to set up a Google Ads account first.<\/p>\n<h2>How to create an account in Google ads<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ll need a regular Google account for your business to set up an account in Google Ads. You might have a personal Gmail account already, but for marketing purposes start by visiting <a href=\"http:\/\/accounts.google.com\">Accounts.Google.com<\/a> and choose the option \u201cto manage my business\u201d when you\u2019re asked why you\u2019re signing up.<\/p>\n<p>Once that\u2019s done and you\u2019re logged in, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/ads.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ads.Google.com.<\/a> You\u2019ll be asked to create a Google Ad campaign right away, but look towards the bottom the screen and click on \u201cSwitch to expert mode.\u201d This gives you more time to find your way around the Google Ad Manager dashboard, learn about developing a successful campaign and other Google Ads best practices.<\/p>\n<h2>How to create a campaign in Google Ad Manager: 5 steps to follow<\/h2>\n<p>With the right planning, you can use your Google Ad Manager to get your products seen by more people who are ready to make a purchase:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Enter the Google Ad Manager Dashboard<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"padding-left: 20px;\">Once you\u2019re inside Google Ad Manager, you\u2019ll see a link that says \u201cCreate New Campaign\u201d on your dashboard.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. Choose your marketing objective and campaign type<\/h3>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 20px;\">\n<p>Some brands use Google Ads to encourage e-mail signups, initiate phone calls or live chats and download other forms of content. If your focus is on eCommerce, you should select \u201cpurchases\u201d as your campaign goal.<\/p>\n<p>From there, you\u2019ll select the type of campaigns that<a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/local-inventory-ads-2023\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> put you in the best position to reach your goal<\/a>. Familiarize yourself with as many kinds as possible. There are details on some of the most common ad formats in the next section below.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>3.\u00a0 Choose your Google Ad bidding strategy<\/h3>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 20px;\">Remember that running a Google Ad campaign means you\u2019re competing with others brands that might be interested in targeting the same kinds of customers. That means you\u2019ll have to determine what kind of budget you\u2019ll allocate towards bidding and whether the money will be spent on how many people see your ad vs. how many people click on it. We\u2019ll delve into the pros and cons of each choice later in this guide. Google can help optimize much of the bidding process if you\u2019re new to these campaigns.<\/div>\n<h3>4. Set up your Google Ad target audience<\/h3>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 20px;\">Precision marketing is all about serving ads to the most appropriate people. Google Ad Manager <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/admanager\/answer\/6022732?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/support.google.com\/admanager\/answer\/6022732?hl=en<\/a> offers many ways to get granular in how you set up target segments. You can focus specifically for those searching for women\u2019s apparel, for instance, as well as country-specific locations like Italy or the U.S. and language. Make sure not to set your parameters too narrowly until you\u2019ve gotten more experience with these campaigns.<\/div>\n<h3>5. Develop an ad that converts<\/h3>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 20px;\">You\u2019ll drive more purchases using Google Ads when you have compelling content that creatively combines text and images. Take advantage of freely available generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to assist with writing strong titles, body copy and optimizing product and lifestyle imagery. Once you\u2019re done, your Google Ad campaign can begin.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>Types of Google ads campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>People consume information in a variety of formats, so think about A\/B testing with a couple of different approaches depending on what you\u2019re selling and what your audience needs to see in order to move forward:<\/p>\n<h3>Display<\/h3>\n<p>Google has an extensive network of partner sites where it can run display ads that predominantly feature images or videos. This can be a good option for when you\u2019re trying to build initial brand awareness and introduce your company and its products to the market.<\/p>\n<h3>Shopping<\/h3>\n<p>Customers want the basics before they buy. This includes the product name, the price and the seller, all of which are presented through Google Shopping Ads. Having<a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/fix-price-mismatch-google-shopping-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> product feeds that can send data directly from your product catalog are essentia<\/a>l in order to have Google Shopping Ads perform as expected.<\/p>\n<h3>App<\/h3>\n<p>This is only so much space on a smartphone screen, which means consumers are becoming more discerning about what they install. Google app ads can use a mix of images, video and text to get the downloads you need to grow your business, especially if your app makes it easy for customers to place and track their orders.<\/p>\n<h3>Local Inventory Ads<\/h3>\n<p>One of the biggest opportunities in eCommerce is to<a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/local-inventory-ads-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> market products based on where customers can easily go and pick them up in person<\/a>. Local inventory ads (LIAs) ensure you only promote what\u2019s in stock near your audience\u2019s current location. A strong product feed management solution is critical here, too.<\/p>\n<h2>How much does Google ads cost? Find out the minimum budget to launch your campaign<\/h2>\n<p>The budget you\u2019ll need to run a Google Ad campaign will vary depending on the industry you\u2019re targeting, average search volume and many other factors. These costs will change over time, but as of early 2024 the average cost per click for a category such as fashion retail, for instance, was US$1.42.<\/p>\n<h2>CPC or CPM?<\/h2>\n<p>Paying on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis means your budget is going directly towards driving activity to your product pages and eCommerce engine. This can be a sound strategy when you\u2019re focused on short-term revenue goals. In other cases, paying on a cost-per-thousand impressions (CPM) basis can allow you to build your reputation among your audience, which can be important for bigger-ticket items that have a longer buying cycle.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Google Ads Keyword Planner and how to choose the most effective keywords<\/h2>\n<p>Google recognizes that not everyone is highly versed in running online ad campaigns. Its Keyword Planner is a tool that provides rich data such as search volume for particular combinations of words, forecasts and much more.<\/p>\n<p>You can look up individual words or upload a CSV file with all the relevant keywords in your industry to identify what you\u2019ll use in your Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p>Choosing the most effective keyword is really a process of putting yourself in your customers\u2019 shoes and imagining what they would type into a search engine when they\u2019re looking for their next purchase.<\/p>\n<h2>Managing Google Ad campaigns: the Highstreet.io solution<\/h2>\n<p>Running Google Ads can involve meeting highly specific requirements, which is not something you\u2019ll want to manage on your own.<\/p>\n<p>Highstreet.io\u2019s product feed management platform makes it easy to <b>tailor your product data to whatever channel you\u2019re using<\/b> for marketing purposes.
