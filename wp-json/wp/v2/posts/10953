While the Internet provides global reach for even the smallest businesses, customer behavior is creating what we might call a \u201cneighborhood economy,\u201d where the ability to meet customers where they are is the ultimate competitive differentiator.<\/p>\n<p>As proof, consider that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/how-to-win-local-search\/416837\/%23close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local search has become the second most important channel<\/a> after organic search, according to a recent article in the <i>Search Engine Journal<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>This makes intuitive sense: Customers may start their research by looking broadly on Google for the products that interest them, but their buying decision will largely be driven by the convenience and speed of the retailer they choose.<\/p>\n<h2>How Local Text Ads Work<\/h2>\n<p>This is where local text ads in Google Ads campaigns provide a way to help streamline the experience for potential customers. By using location-targeted campaigns whose ad groups are used to configure local keywords and local ads, local text ads answer an urgent question:<\/p>\n<p><strong><i>\u201cWhere are [luxury designer jackets] near me?\u201d<\/i><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Local text ads can drive conversions with only a headline, a display URL, and a brief description.<br \/>\nEven within those creative constraints, it\u2019s possible to convey a unique selling proposition in a way that immediately builds credibility.<br \/>\nThink of someone who\u2019s looking for ethically produced cashmere sweaters. When they search on Google, they might see an ad like the fictitious one below before they even scroll down to see the organic results:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Cashmere wool sweaters with sustainability in mind<\/strong><br \/>\nwww.planetfriendlycashmere.com<br \/>\n<i>Read reviews from our more than 1,000 satisfied customers and explore our extensive range of ethically sourced and produced cashmere wool sweaters.

These include apparel, accessories, and many other retail products.<\/li>\n<li>Google LIAs are also managed by Google, which assigns areas and location keywords using data from a linked Google My Business account.<\/li>\n<li>Consumers might land on local inventory ads when they enter a search on Google like, \u201cdesigner handbags near me,\u201d or \u201cbuy pencil skirts in [city or town].\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Beyond text, Google LIAs allow retailers to feature images of their product as well as the price or other details such as measurements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When consumers click through, local inventory ads also act as digital storefronts by answering all the other frequently asked questions (FAQs) that run through customers\u2019 minds. The ad will tell them exactly how far away a store location is, for instance, hours of operation, and more details about the product.<\/p>\n<h2>Why a Local-First Approach to the Customer Journey Matters<\/h2>\n<p>Customers may continue to randomly visit stores to see if a product is available, but increased concerns around safety protocols and simply the time they potentially waste mean they\u2019re increasingly likely to begin their search online.<\/p>\n<p>Based on what they learn from local text ads or local inventory ads, consumers can arm themselves with information to take the next step in their journey.<\/p>\n<p>For some, this might include making an in-person visit, but not necessarily in the store environment. They might order online for curbside delivery instead.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10961\" src=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Harness-the-Power-03.jpg\" alt=\"How To Harness the Power Of Local Text Ads And Local Inventory Ads In The Emerging \u2018Neighborhood Economy\u2019\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Local text and local inventory ads aren\u2019t just great marketing tools.
