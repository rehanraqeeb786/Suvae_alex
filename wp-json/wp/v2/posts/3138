Simple enough at first, until you want to achieve more with your shopping campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, you&#8217;ll discover the key factors to determine when you need to take the next step to a <strong>full-service data management platform. <\/strong>But first, let&#8217;s review what a Data Management Platform is and how it can benefit you and your business.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">What is a Product Data Management Platform?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data Feed Management Platform is a software platform used to collect and manage all your product data. This system allows you to have highly <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">optimized information about your products, centralizing all those details into one file(product feed) to better promote your products across multiple channels, in different markets, and reach targeted audiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Full-Service Data Feed Management Platform helps you with all your <\/span><b>data management<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> needs, from data feed creation, configuration, optimization, and synchronization, to customization.<br \/>\n<\/span>Let&#8217;s dive into some of the reasons why and when you should consider a Full-Service Product Data Management Platform<\/p>\n<h2>Promote Products in other Countries, Currencies &amp; Languages<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to advertise your products in other countries, languages, and currencies there are a few challenges you might be facing.<\/p>\n<p>To customize campaigns for different markets, you want to create dedicated feeds for each specific channel and customize your campaigns for each market you are going to sell on.<br \/>\nHere are some examples of <strong>scenarios that require separate feeds:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to tie a promotion to a\u00a0certain country and not have that promotion show up in your other feeds.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to use dedicated promotions in certain countries and you don&#8217;t want the promotions showing up in other markets.<\/li>\n<li>When your product data from the master source contains some data that is only in one language and you want to remove it for other countries.<\/li>\n<li>Your inventory might change for different countries depending on where the merchandise is being stored.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you start advertising in more than one country and you\u2019re creating multiple feeds for each channel in each country you need to be able to manage a large volume of feeds. This might not be that easy.<\/p>\n<p>Here is where a <strong>full-service data management feed platform can help<\/strong>. The platform and service allow you to <strong>manage all your feeds, making sure they are all updated correctly as well as optimized for each country and channel.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Increase the Number of Products To Sell<\/h3>\n<p>As your business grows so can your product inventory. If you find you have ongoing technical feed issues because of the volume of your products then it is time to look at a full-service data feed management platform.<br \/>\nSome of the<strong> typical challenges brands and retailers have when they increase their product inventory<\/strong> can be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product variants are mixed up when the data is pulled from the eCommerce platform. They need to be adjusted and reordered to match Google&#8217;s requirements.<\/li>\n<li>The more products you sell the more likely your products will sell out. If your inventory displaying in your ads isn\u2019t up-to-date because it\u2019s taking too long to synchronize with the website then the channel you\u2019re advertising on might stop showing your ads.<\/li>\n<li>If you\u2019re selling high volumes of products on your site the need for real-time synchronization of your products might be needed. You always want your website inventory to match the inventory displayed on other channels that promote your products.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re having these challenges then it might be<strong> time to start working with a product data feed management company<\/strong>. Keep reading to learn more.<\/p>\n<h3>Increase the Number of Distribution Channels<\/h3>\n<p>The more channels you advertise on the more technical issues you\u2019ll have. Seriously, do you have that much time to dedicate to feed issues?<\/p>\n<p>Nearly every distribution channel you use to promote your products has different feed specifications. This means the product data within each feed should be customized to the needs of that channel and follow channel requirements. If you\u2019re promoting your products in 5 different channels that means 5 feeds times the number of countries you\u2019re advertising in.<\/p>\n<p>Some popular distribution channels include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Comparison Shopping Websites &amp; Search Engine Marketing:<\/strong> Google Shopping, Bing Shopping, Nextag, Shopzilla &amp; PriceGrabber<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social Commerce:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/facebook-dynamic-product-ads\/\">Facebook Dynamic Product Ads<\/a>, Instagram Shoppable Posts<\/li>\n<li><strong>Affiliate Networks:<\/strong> Rakuten\/Linkshare, CJ, <a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/join-awin-affiliate-program\/\">Awin<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Retargeting Networks:<\/strong> Criteo &amp; AdRoll<\/li>\n<li><strong>On-Site Services\/Tools:<\/strong> Site Search, Recommendation Engines &amp; Size Finders<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Feed requirements to promote your products across channels are constantly changing. We\u2019ve provided only a few examples above but there are hundreds of options depending on which country you\u2019re advertising in. For more details on available channels, take a look at the full list of <a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/marketing-channels\/\">marketing channels<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/marketplace-channels\/\">marketplace channels<\/a> you can connect to<\/p>\n<h2>Customize Your Product Data With the Right Platform<\/h2>\n<p>Troubleshooting and customizing your feeds for the best outcomes can take up much time and resources. A Full-Service Data Management Feed Platform helps you save time on manual tasks by automatically displaying your products and effectively reaching the right customers on multiple channels.<br \/>\nHere are some typical examples of customizations and data manipulations Highstreet.io takes care of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website scraping to get <strong>specific data that is not being captured in master feeds<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Adding GTINs<\/strong> from an outside source to be included in the feeds: these codes might not be available in master feeds or eCommerce platforms<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reconfiguration of Product Titles and Categories<\/strong> to follow a specific channel\u2019s requirements, including important information customers are looking for<\/li>\n<li><strong>Adding product promotion information<\/strong> at specific times of the year<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Time is money and leaving the technical details to a trusted feed management partner means you can focus on other important marketing matters.
