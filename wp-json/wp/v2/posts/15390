If you are one of these superheroes you know that to get ahead of the competition you need to prioritize the work that gets you the best results. When planning your marketing activities to deliver the best ROI, product feed optimization should be at the top of the list.<\/p>\n<p>Your product feeds are your most valuable marketing assets to scale your sales on marketplaces and marketing channels. To meet your goals, the quality and relevancy of your product information within your feed should be exceptional to provide a successful customer shopping experience. The saying &#8220;Garbage in, Garbage Out&#8221; couldn&#8217;t be more accurate.<\/p>\n<p>Read on to discover everything you need to know about product feed optimization. This includes translating feed technical requirements into understandable and actionable tasks to improve your product listing results.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Product Feed Optimization?<\/h2>\n<p>The term &#8220;product feed optimization&#8221; sounds vague and mysterious, but when you break it down to the basics, the concept is simple to understand.<\/p>\n<p>Product feed optimization is a process that e-commerce businesses use to ensure their products are visible to potential customers on various online sales channels. A well-optimized product feed helps marketers to generate more relevant ads based on searches, structure ads in a way that appeals to customers&#8217; needs, and control the timing of when and what ads customers see, defined by the seller.<\/p>\n<h2>Why is Data Feed Optimization Important?<\/h2>\n<p>Your eCommerce operation relies on the successful integration and synchronization of product information, ensuring its consistency across all of your platforms and channels. Shopping Feed optimizations affect your campaign success by fully leveraging the number of available offers and by accurately matching ads to products users are interested in.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine a product feed having so much impact on your marketing performance. To help you understand why optimization is important, let\u2019s break down the benefits.<\/p>\n<h3>Top 5 Benefits of Product Feed Optimization<b><\/b><\/h3>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 15px;\">\n<ul>\n<li><b>Better visibility &amp; search relevancy<br \/>\n<\/b>By optimizing product feeds with the right keywords, descriptions, and product attributes, you can improve your product listings&#8217; search relevancy, making it easier for customers to find them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Accurate showcasing of your inventory<br \/>\n<\/b>Shopping ads require specific product information, such as product name, description, price, and availability. By optimizing your product feeds with frequently refreshed data you ensure customers see the most up-to-date information for accurate pricing, product details, and inventory.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Increased conversions from your listings<br \/>\n<\/b>By providing up-to-date product information, customer trust and confidence increases for your products and brand, leading to higher product listing clicks and conversions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Save time and resources by automating the product listing process<br \/>\n<\/b>Product feed optimization tools allow you to easily create and manage product feeds across multiple platforms, reducing the time and effort required to list products manually.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Fewer Google Merchant Center (GMC) disapprovals<br \/>\n<\/b>Google has strict requirements for shopping feeds. When your Google Shopping feed and website product pages are optimized, you have fewer product disapprovals. This process increases the exposure of your ads.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>More granular campaign segmentation<br \/>\n<\/b>By providing accurate and optimized product properties to Google Merchant Center, advertisers can segment their campaigns by designing ad groups based on the selection of accurate categories, taxonomies, other properties, or other custom attributes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Master Data Feed Optimization<\/h2>\n<p>How do you begin your feed optimization process? You start with creating a quality master feed which is used as the basis for making additional data feeds for each marketing channel like Google, Facebook, Instagram, and others.<\/p>\n<p><b>Here are the steps to build the basis for an optimized master data feed:<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 15px;\">\n<ul>\n<li><b>Understand where and how your product data is stored<br \/>\n<\/b>The first step is understanding what data you need, where it resides (eCommerce platform, PIM, spreadsheet, etc.), and how it&#8217;s displayed on your website. This process can be very simple or complex. Talking to a <a href=\"http:\/\/Suvae.org\/product-feed-management\">Product Feed Management provider<\/a> to help you at this stage could alleviate problems with your product listings down the road.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Outline where (countries) you want to promote your products and on what channels<br \/>\n<\/b>When you get into <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/create-a-multi-country-product-feed-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multi-country and multi-currency product feeds<\/a>, simple things like the structure of your website URLs, the price shown on your website, and the product information on your pages should align with the channel&#8217;s requirements you are selling on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Identify the data you need for the channel you are selling on<br \/>\n<\/b>Each channel&#8217;s requirements may be different. Doing your research to stay on top of these ever-changing requirements helps to identify the gaps in missing and incorrect product data.

They advise advertisers to avoid promotional text and align their landing page&#8217;s title with the title in their feed.<\/p>\n<p>A product feed management solution allows you to create rules so that if specific attributes aren&#8217;t available, you can replace them with other details or even add a plural to make the title read better.<\/p>\n<p><i>Product Title Example:<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Brand [blank] Product Name (when available) [blank] product type (when available and not in the product name)[,] gender (plural with &#8216;s)[,] [material])[,] color[,] size<\/p>\n<h4><b>Color<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Google Merchant Center recommends if you use a unique color, on your landing page, you should submit that value through the [color] attribute. Google crawls your landing page and matches the color in your feed to what&#8217;s on your landing page. If there is a mismatch, then Google Merchant Center could produce an error.<\/p>\n<p>They recommend adding a more common color name, like &#8220;Red&#8221; or &#8220;Black&#8221;, to your title [title]. These accepted terms help ensure that your products are correctly categorized and displayed in relevant search results.<\/p>\n<h4><b>Category<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Instead of leaving Google&#8217;s product category [google_product_category] attribute blank, use it to help create findable products by people searching for them in your category. If you don&#8217;t provide category information within your feed, you run the risk of Google automatically categorizing your products.<\/p>\n<p>An example of a well-chosen product category for a dress is <i>Clothing &amp; Accessories &gt; Clothing &gt; Dresses<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Get more in-depth information on <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/google-shopping-optimization-product-category\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Google Product Category Optimization<\/b><\/a><b>.<\/b><\/p>\n<h4><b>GTIN<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>The Global Trade Item Number, or GTIN, is no longer a required attribute for your Google Shopping feed but is still worth using in your optimization process.
