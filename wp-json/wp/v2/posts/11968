We see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/693438\/affiliate-marketing-spending\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. affiliate marketing spending approaching 8.2 billion U.S. dollars<\/a> this year, up from 5.4 billion recorded in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>Today, eCommerce affiliate marketing is integral to the success of a brand\u2019s digital marketing strategy. By integrating with the right programs and networks, you can advertise your products through posts that show everything from basic product information to more in-depth content like product demonstrations, personal testimonials, and strong calls to action.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the <strong>Benefits of Affiliate Marketing Programs<\/strong> include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generating additional revenue<\/li>\n<li>Establishing partnerships with influencers in the market<\/li>\n<li>Increasing your brand&#8217;s reach online<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Keep reading to learn how eCommerce affiliate marketing has changed over the years, what affiliate networks and programs are available for the fashion industry, and how providing high-quality product information to your affiliates can boost your products&#8217; discoverability.<\/p>\n<h2>How eCommerce Affiliate Marketing Has Changed<\/h2>\n<p>Since the advent of the internet, businesses have found ways to advertise online. While many saw the<b> potential of affiliate marketing<\/b>, it took some time for the practice to pick up steam over the years.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few of the trends that have molded this advertising option into today&#8217;s promotional powerhouse:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The rise of social media<\/strong>: In the early stage of social media, back in the 2000s, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram had just started to become popular.<br \/>\nAs a result, affiliate programs rarely considered them and instead looked to websites and blogs.<br \/>\nToday, some affiliates operate exclusively through networks like Instagram, Pinterest, and others. Content creators have also entered the scene, monetizing their popularity and traffic creatively.<br \/>\nWith almost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tradedoubler.com\/pl\/blog\/top-global-trends-in-affiliate-marketing-for-2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">three-quarters of social networking users<\/a> entrusting their purchasing decisions to their platforms of choice, it&#8217;s clear why social media is such a powerful marketing channel today.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Mobile marketing hit the scene: <\/b>Back when flip phones and Blackberries with keyboards were popular, marketing through mobile devices hardly existed.<br \/>\nNowadays, it would be unthinkable to start an affiliate program without focusing on smart devices because of the shift from desktop to mobile content consumption.<br \/>\nAccording to Statista&#8217;s Digital Market Outlook, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/19792\/global-mobile-ad-spending-distribution-by-platform\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mobile will account for 50 percent of ad spending by 2021 and finally surpass desktop in 2022.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>A focus on quality over quantity: <\/b>In the 2000s and early 2010s, businesses aimed to make their affiliate programs as large as possible to cast the widest net of exposure.<br \/>\nOnce advertisers understood how affiliate systems worked, they became more interested in carefully selecting the best quality affiliates, giving them the right resources and support to be true business partners.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Trust has gone up: <\/b>Affiliate programs and networks were focused more on getting as many referral fees as possible before the late 2010s. They joined multiple programs and often made poor attempts at attaching to any one brand.<br \/>\nToday, trust is the theme, and advertisers want the affiliate program to align with their brand&#8217;s strategy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve learned about eCommerce affiliate marketing, how do advertisers use networks and programs to drive brand awareness and generate revenue?<\/p>\n<h2>How Affiliate Programs Work<\/h2>\n<p>Affiliation programs involve partnerships between an advertiser and one or more affiliates.<br \/>\nThe advertiser signs a contract with an individual affiliate or a network of affiliates to promote their products or services for a commission. Everything from a direct sale to new sign-ups for a free trial is tracked so the advertiser can understand how their ads are performing<\/p>\n<p><b>A typical program follows these steps:<\/b><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The business places an advertisement on the affiliate&#8217;s blog, website, or social networking page. A unique link helps track which affiliates are contributing to which visitors.<\/li>\n<li>When a customer clicks on the link and makes a purchase, the affiliate network records the transaction details.<\/li>\n<li>The business pays the affiliate the commission for those sales. It adds up to what is a profit-sharing mechanism.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Examples of eCommerce Affiliate Marketing Programs for the Fashion Industry<\/h3>\n<p>Affiliate programs help many industries <b>effectively manage their digital advertising programs<\/b>, especially in the fashion sector.<br \/>\nSome popular fashion affiliate marketing programs offer enticing advertising opportunities for brands.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nordstrom.com\/browse\/affiliate-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nordstrom<\/a>: <\/b>This retailer is one of the world&#8217;s most well-known brands with its affiliate network.
