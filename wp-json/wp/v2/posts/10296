Let\u2019s start by giving it a proper definition.<\/p>\n<h2>What is omnichannel customer experience?<\/h2>\n<p>Customers were once limited to a single channel \u2013 a physical store \u2013 to buy the products they wanted. As more digital options emerged, many retailers began taking what was called a multi-channel approach, where they offered several ways to browse and purchase items. In many cases, however, physical stores and digital channels operated in silos.<\/p>\n<p>An omnichannel customer experience works far more cohesively, recognizing that customers may use some channels to research their purchase and another to actually make an eCommerce transaction. Exploring this kind of journey using the what\/when\/where framework may help show what this should look like.<\/p>\n<h4>The \u2018what\u2019 every omnichannel experience needs<\/h4>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the <b><i>what<\/i><\/b>: Consumers shopping for luxury goods want to easily find their way to their favorite brands. They likely have a specific size and color in mind. They don\u2019t want to waste time sorting through the wrong items, whether they\u2019re online or in a store.<\/p>\n<h4>The \u2018when\u2019 that meets customer expectations<\/h4>\n<p>Next comes the <b><i>when<\/i><\/b>: You build customer satisfaction as a brand by only showing what\u2019s currently in stock, with the prices that reflect current promotions or discounts. Tracking e-commerce orders and ensuring items will be ready to pick up in-store on time is essential.<\/p>\n<h4>The \u2018where\u2019 that defines an omnichannel shopping experience<\/h4>\n<p>Then there is the <b><i>where<\/i><\/b> factor: While shopping in person is slowly coming back, customers are proving highly adept at finding inspiration across a variety of digital touchpoints. They might spot the skirt on an Instagram influencer and want to add it to their own wardrobe. They might see a search ad and think, \u201cYes!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The most successful retailers develop an omnichannel customer experience that leaves no stone unturned \u2013 and in this case, the stones are all the places a customer might be ready to engage with a brand.<br \/>\n<b>Enhanced product data feeds<\/b> can help address all of these areas. According to Gartner Inc., time is of the essence: the market research firm has predicted that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/gartner-marketing-research-shows-50--of-brands-will-have-failed-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50% of brands will fail to unify customer engagement channels<\/a> in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>Get ahead of the pack by addressing the following <b>common omnichannel eCommerce challenges <\/b>and making the most of your technology investments:<\/p>\n<h2>Reimagine what a \u2018shopping trip\u2019 looks like<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12284\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Reimagine-what-a-shopping-trip-looks-like.jpg\" alt=\"Reimagine what a shopping trip looks like\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Reimagine-what-a-shopping-trip-looks-like.jpg 700w, https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Reimagine-what-a-shopping-trip-looks-like-480x309.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Before eCommerce options became widely available, consumers might have visited their favorite stores on the weekends, during their lunch hour, or whenever they had a few minutes to spare in their schedules.<\/p>\n<p>This notion of a \u201cshopping trip\u201d has been completely transformed thanks to digital channels. Research from Radial shows that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.radial.com\/press-room\/press-releases\/consumers-using-blend-of-pickup-options\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">54% of consumers are shopping more online than in 2020<\/a>, with one-third saying they are looking for items multiple times a week.<br \/>\nThat means they might click on an ad one day, come back to the brand\u2019s site via social media a few days later but only hit the \u201corder\u201d button when they\u2019re on a marketplace the following evening.<\/p>\n<p>Synching your products via <b>enhanced product feeds streamlines the process of creating omnichannel experiences<\/b> by being visible across multiple shopping destinations at once.<br \/>\nAs you do so, develop marketing campaigns that recognize shoppers\u2019 changing online behaviors, using personalized offers or expert recommendations for complementary products to nurture them to make a purchase.<\/p>\n<h2>Provide details and support across the full customer journey<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12285\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Provide-details-and-support.jpg\" alt=\"Provide details and support\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Provide-details-and-support.jpg 700w, https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Provide-details-and-support-480x309.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>Product feed management technology<\/b> provides retailers a single view into their orders, which makes traditional inventory management challenges less of a hassle.

This leaves customers having to fill in the blanks on their own, and they\u2019re more likely to simply look for a retailer with more detailed listings.<\/p>\n<p>In-store associates often become very good at knowing the most common questions customers will have when they\u2019re browsing the aisles. Your omnichannel experience needs to be just as thought-through.<\/p>\n<p>Product feed management technology will <b>simplify the process of optimizing product listings<\/b> based on the needs of different marketplaces, but you can also improve your odds of conversion by including all the features and details that differentiate your products from competitors.<\/p>\n<h2>Create a consistent look and feel the entire world can recognize<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12297\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Create-a-consistent-look-and-feel.jpg\" alt=\"Create a consistent look and feel\" width=\"700\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Create-a-consistent-look-and-feel.jpg 700w, https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Create-a-consistent-look-and-feel-480x315.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019ve developed a loyal customer base in your local market, ignoring the growth opportunities in other geographies means you\u2019re leaving money on the table.<\/p>\n<p>Just look at a forecast from eMarketer that showed how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.channeladvisor.com\/blog\/industry-trends\/new-emarketer-analyst-report-what-the-global-e-commerce-forecast-holds-for-2022\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rising players in terms of global eCommerce sales<\/a> are emerging in areas such as Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.
