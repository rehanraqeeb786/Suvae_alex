The best place to start is with your product titles. Not that other parts of the feed like description, category, and images aren\u2019t important, but for improved CTR and compliance with Google Shopping\u2019s matching algorithm, titles are where it\u2019s at.<br \/>\nLearn how you can get your Product Titles optimized in Google Shopping<\/p>\n<h2>Google Shopping Product Title Optimization: Requirements<\/h2>\n<p>The first step to optimizing your Google Shopping titles is to become familiar with Google Shopping title requirements. Google evaluates your product title to determine whether or not your listing will be relevant to what users are searching for so it&#8217;s important for you to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be specific.<\/strong> Include the brand, gender, designer, color, and name of the product that is displayed on your website.<br \/>\nGoogle will match the title from the website landing page to the product Ad title.<\/li>\n<li>Ask yourself, <strong>how would someone search for a product like yours<\/strong>?<br \/>\nThe more information you can provide the easier it is for Google Shopping to match your products with their search results.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Google Merchant Center &#8211; Best Practices<\/h3>\n<p>As stated by Google, here are the requirements for title structure for all products:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Required:<\/strong> Your products name<br \/>\n<strong>Example:<\/strong> Men&#8217;s Pique Polo Shirt<br \/>\n<strong>Syntax:<\/strong> Max 150 Characters<br \/>\n<strong>Schema.org property<\/strong>: Product. name<\/p>\n<p><strong>More requirements<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accurately describe your product and match the title from your landing page<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t include promotional text like free shipping, all capital letters, or gimmicky foreign characters<\/li>\n<li>For variants\n<ul>\n<li>Include a distinguishing feature like color or size<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>For mobile devices\n<ul>\n<li>Include &#8220;with contract&#8221; if sold with a contract<\/li>\n<li>For the United States include &#8220;with payment plan&#8221; if sold in installments<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>For Russia\n<ul>\n<li>For books and other information products, including the age rating at the beginning of the title<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Google Shopping Product Title Optimization: Structure<\/h2>\n<p>Always go from left to right in order of importance. The most relevant information should be on the left as Google weighs the first few terms more heavily as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpcstrategy.com\/product-listing-ads\/shopping-feed-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CPC Strategy<\/a> concluded based on their research.<br \/>\nIn this search result, brand, name, and color are the most important variables in the product listing results.<\/p>\n<p>For products that aren\u2019t filtered in Google Shopping by brand, you might want to focus on other important descriptors like gender, the product itself, color, and size. Even including the type of fabric can help narrow down a search or give you an edge against a competitor who included less information in the title of a competing product.<\/p>\n<p>Simple is best when naming your products. Note that in the above example, the advertiser used practical names like \u201cjackets\u201d and \u201cblazer\u201d to include in the title of the product and \u201cred\u201d as the color name.<br \/>\nFor instance, most searchers are not looking for colors like \u201ccrimson\u201d when looking for a \u201cred\u201d blazer.
