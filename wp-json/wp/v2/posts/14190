Those systems contain priceless information about your inventory, your orders, and your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/how-data-feed-management-enhances-your-digital-marketing-strategy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">product feed that connect to online marketplaces and essential digital channels<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why they need to be protected with the kind of security that AWS Cognito MFA (multi-factor authentication) can provide.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much like showing an employee identification card when you show up in an office, authentication technologies are a way to confirm that only authorized people are logging into your backend infrastructure.<br \/>\nFor years, authentication was often limited to the use of passwords, even though they were often forgotten by employees and easy to guess by cybercriminals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides additional layers of protection to digital platforms<\/strong> by requiring additional credentials. These could include something you know, such as a PIN, sending a text to your smartphone, or even scanning biometric data like your fingerprint or your face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Highstreet.io, we\u2019re reducing the burden on brands to<strong> focus on security and offer peace of mind by standardizing our user authentication<\/strong> based on AWS Cognito MFA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This post offers some more detail on our approach, and why it will let you spend more time on the products you\u2019re selling and the customers you\u2019re serving.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Platform Authentication \u2013 A Technical Choice Using AWS<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve standardized on AWS Cognito MFA because it was purposely designed to help organizations authenticate and manage users whether they\u2019re looking into a web portal or a mobile app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Highstreet.io\u2019s case, the main component for authentication is based on a directory of people who will need to access the platform, which is called a user pool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This provides a seamless way to manage each user\u2019s profile while also checking for suspicious activity such as an attempt by a hacker to take over someone\u2019s account or to verify a credential like an e-mail address.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We like Cognito MFA because it\u2019s scalable as more users get added, and it also allows customization at the user interface (UI) level, which means we can provide a front end that\u2019s familiar and easy to use.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Components of the Infrastructure Authentication<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When you put a key in a lock, you don\u2019t usually get to see the gears and other components that turn and allow you to open a door. The diagram below provides an insider view of what happens when your users are logging into Highstreet.io.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14191\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/HS-authentication.drawio.jpg\" alt=\"HS authentication drawio\" width=\"750\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/HS-authentication.drawio.jpg 750w, https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/HS-authentication.drawio-480x230.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The system makes use of Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), which are environments where application programming interfaces (APIs) can be created and run in isolation from the underlying hardware.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re trying to authenticate who you are, the user pool grants tokens that authorize requests that get made to the containerized HTTP API.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve been authenticated, you can dive into Highstreet.io and begin <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/new-omnichannel-shopping-experience-retailers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">configuring your product feeds<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for more accurate ads, marketplace listings, and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Infrastructure as Code<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping this kind of backend infrastructure with the needs of a business would have traditionally required a lot of time and effort, but Highstreet.io\u2019s use of infrastructure has changed all that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is infrastructure as code? Think of it as a way of using coding to automate complex processes rather than relying on manual (and often error-prone work).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More specifically, we learn about Terraform\u2019s infrastructure as code software to create, change and improve our user authentication.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where Highstreet.io stands: What you get as a Customer<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Combining infrastructure as code with AWS Cognito MFA, we\u2019re able to provide a<strong> cost-effective, high-speed, consistent, and secure user authentication experience<\/strong> that benefits all our customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having complete control and visibility over who\u2019s logging on at all times also means Highstreet.io can continuously improve our approach to AWS Cognito multi-factor authentication.<br \/>\nTerraform helps us keep track of versioning so that changes to the underlying infrastructure can happen incrementally, as new eCommerce needs emerge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might not think about how users are logging into Highstreet.io on a day-to-day basis, or whether your organization is at any risk of an IT security incident.
