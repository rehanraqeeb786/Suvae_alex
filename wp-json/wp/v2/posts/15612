Ads<b>\u00a0with a high entertainment value scored 15% higher for purchase intent.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Having a TikTok product feed is just as important as making an ad funny or heartwarming, though. Consumers need to see products with accurate, up-to-date details before they click a \u201cbuy\u201d button. When it\u2019s done right, however, selling on <a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/start-selling-on-tik-tok\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok could be an important growth driver<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of selling on TikTok<\/h2>\n<p>Just consider the results of a survey published in early 2023 that showed<a href=\"https:\/\/getcircuit.com\/teams\/blog\/tiktok-ecommerce-survey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 83% of consumers believe TikTok will become the home shopping network of our digital age<\/a>. This has attracted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theroot.com\/rihanna-is-looking-for-the-ultimate-fenty-fan-on-tiktok-1849613824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">big brands like Fenty Beauty<\/a>, which got headlines for running contests and other marketing tactics on TikTok.

Yes, because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It\u2019s the third-largest social platform, with<a href=\"https:\/\/www.insiderintelligence.com\/charts\/global-tiktok-user-stats\/#:~:text=TikTok%20will%20have%20834.3%20million,phenomenon%20has%20been%20incredibly%20quick.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> more than 800 million users<\/a> (and still growing!).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Achieving reach within large consumer segments matters, especially when you\u2019re selling luxury products across multiple geographies. Marketing on TikTok should be just as big a priority as being present on other popular channels, such as search engines or display advertising.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Though it attracts users of all ages,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/statistics\/tiktok-age-demographics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> the largest TikTok segment is between 18-34<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For brands in segments like fashion, this represents one of the most covetable demographics, based on disposable income and typically high levels of shopping and spending activity. It\u2019s an audience where the marketing return on investment (ROI) may be higher.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>TikTok\u2019s<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/social-media-updates\/tiktok\/tiktok-discovery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> \u201cFor You\u201d page<\/a> is designed to help people discover people brands they don\u2019t know.<br \/>\nOther social platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, organize feeds primarily based on content from someone you\u2019re following. That can make it more difficult to raise brand awareness among new prospects. TikTok\u2019s approach has become so successful it is being replicated on other social platforms, including Twitter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>TikTok also provides<b> brands flexibility<\/b> in terms of creating effective marketing content to reach their business goals, such as driving more revenue, increasing share of wallet among existing customers, and increasing brand affinity. Marketers can create their TikToks using little more than a smartphone, for example, showcasing stylish products in a way that feels native to the platform. Brands can also <b>partner with influencers<\/b> and creators who already have large followings on TikTok that point them to their TikTok Shop.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Get the Details on <a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/start-selling-on-tik-tok\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Sell Products on TikTok<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>What Is TikTok Shop?<\/h2>\n<p>Initially available in locations such as Southeast Asia,<a href=\"https:\/\/shop.tiktok.com\/business\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> TikTok has continued to roll out TikTok Shop<\/a>, which allows merchants to display their products to its community, along with directly integrating e-commerce capabilities for shoppers for a smooth purchasing experience.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok Shop also includes tools to manage campaigns, analytics to track marketing performance, and access to collaborate directly with creators.<\/p>\n<p>Selling on TikTok via TikTok Shop isn\u2019t limited to shopping ad campaigns but merchant-led live videos and in-stream videos. For many brands, however, the most natural starting point will be simply setting up a <b>TikTok product feed <\/b>to ensure their products are being featured where their customers are most likely to be browsing online. Before that, though, it\u2019s important to understand how your ads will show up on the platform.<\/p>\n<h2>TikTok Shopping Ads Formats<\/h2>\n<p>There are also several options for formatting your TikTok ads. You might want to consider trying them all and doubling down on those that prove most successful after running a test for some time.<\/p>\n<p>Live shopping ads, for instance, are probably best suited for a time-sensitive event, such as the launch or availability of a new product. They will be seen in real-time as people are scrolling through TikTok and can be a chance to answer questions and get a work-through of products in detail.<\/p>\n<p>Video shopping ads appear on the \u201cFor You\u201d page of the app, which means they might work well as a way to raise brand awareness among consumers who don\u2019t yet know your brand very well. The good thing about these ads is that the videos are shoppable, meaning people can place orders directly if they like what they see.<\/p>\n<p>Catalog listing ads are probably the most familiar format if you\u2019ve run campaigns through channels such as Google. Setting up a TikTok product catalog allows you to curate the items you want to curate and highlight to the app\u2019s discerning audience.<\/p>\n<p>No matter which format you choose, you need to make sure your ads feature the most relevant items from your catalog, which is where a TikTok product feed comes in.<\/p>\n<h2>How To Create A TikTok Product Feed<\/h2>\n<p>Much like other <a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/reach-customers-social-commerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social commerce platforms<\/a>, you can begin<a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article\/create-manage-catalogs?redirected=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> setting up a TikTok product feed<\/a> once you\u2019ve created an account on the TikTok Business Center. This requires time and attention to detail.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Create your TikTok product feed catalog<\/h3>\n<p>With the \u201cCatalog\u201d area of the TikTok Business Center, choose \u201cAdd Catalog.\u201d Enter details such as your catalog name and business center account as well as your:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Location<\/li>\n<li>Default currency<\/li>\n<li>Targeting location<\/li>\n<li>Industry<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Select \u201cCreate\u201d to finish setting up your catalog.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Choose your product upload option<\/h3>\n<p>From there, you can begin to add items to your TikTok product feed in one of two ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>by entering detailed information about each product<\/li>\n<li>by working with a partner that offers a solution to automate your TikTok product feed. In this scenario, we\u2019re walking through all the steps in manually adding products<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve created a catalog, navigate to the area called \u201cManage\u201d and then \u201cProducts.\u201d This will present you with a template to download.<\/p>\n<p>In the same area, select \u201cAdd products\u201d and click on \u201cManually add.\u201d Click \u201cNext\u201d and then begin entering all the required product information. When you\u2019re done, click on \u201cImport.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>3. Enter product attributes<\/h3>\n<p>TikTok\u2019s Catalog Manager requires<a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article\/catalog-product-parameters?redirected=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> nine different mandatory fields<\/a> for every product you sell on its platform. This includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product images<\/li>\n<li>SKU ID<\/li>\n<li>Description<\/li>\n<li>Price<\/li>\n<li>Video URLs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To maximize the potential of selling on TikTok, you probably want to consider the 27 optional fields as well.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Tiktok-Feed-Structure.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16173 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Tiktok-Feed-Structure-mni3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"819\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>4. Choose a storage format for product attribute data<\/h3>\n<p>Most brands have many different products to include in their feed. Make sure you store them as a CSV, XML, ZIP, or other appropriate format<\/p>\n<h3>5. Establish your feed schedule<\/h3>\n<p>Depending on how often products get updated within your catalog, you may want to schedule feeds on a daily or even hourly basis. Remember that consumers will be expecting all your catalog data to be accurate and error-free. If you\u2019re choosing hourly, you\u2019ll need to indicate the precise time the file updates should begin.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Choose a product update method<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ll be primarily adding or updating details to the items in your TikTok product feed, upload the file you need for each one. If you\u2019re replacing your data feed, you\u2019ll need to upload a new one where the existing one was located. Choose \u201cImport\u201d to complete this process.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Group products into sets<\/h3>\n<p>Find \u201cProduct Set\u201d within the \u201cCategory area and choose \u201cCreate a product set.\u201d From there, you can either manually select one product at a time by clicking on \u201cManually Select Products\u201d or \u201cUse Filters\u201d to make it easier to create product campaigns. Click \u201cConfirm\u201d when you\u2019re done.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Add new product sources<\/h3>\n<p>Although you need to choose an initial source when you\u2019re first setting up your TikTok product feed, you can introduce others later on. This is done simply by choosing \u201cAdd Products\u201d after selecting \u201cProduct Sources\u201d in the \u201cConfigure\u201d area. Remember that TikTok needs to review all the ads that run on its platform \u2013 it suggests only having one data feed per catalog to expedite this process.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Edit and add products<\/h3>\n<p>There is still plenty of opportunity to make changes to your product information after they\u2019ve been added to your catalog. You\u2019ll find the edit button by hovering over the product name, which will allow you to make changes in each field. The product SKU ID has to remain the same, however. If you need to delete a product because it has been discontinued or your brand is no longer carrying it, click a checkmark next to the product and choose \u201cDisable\u201d from a nearby drop-down menu.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Establish TikTok product catalog rules<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes you\u2019ll want to make minor changes to your product information, and TikTok offers a rules-based mechanism for doing so. Just choose \u201cProduct Sources\u201d within your catalog, click on the source name, and select \u201cAdd Rules\u201d under the settings tab.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll have several options here. You can opt for \u201cValue Replacement\u201d to swap one value in a product with another, set \u201cDefault Value\u201d or even \u201cMapping\u201d to map a value from your file into a TikTok-supported column. \u201cRegex Replace\u201d is a way of substituting inventory details in your TikTok product feed file with a new value.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ads.tiktok.com\/help\/article\/create-manage-catalogs?redirected=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok\u2019s Business help center offers even more details<\/a> on every step in this process.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to remember that manually adding products isn\u2019t a one-time exercise. Pricing, for instance, will only be displayed in the currency you chose when your product was created. If you use TikTok to sell into new markets, it will have to be updated. The same goes for changes to product descriptions, SKU IDs, and more.<\/p>\n<h2>Why you should use a product feed management platform for selling on TikTok<\/h2>\n<p>Automating product feed management takes away the hours otherwise spent adding and updating items to your catalog, while also<b> improving the accuracy of all the data<\/b> your customers will see.<\/p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/product-feed-management\/social-ecommerce\/\">Highstreet.io\u2019s Social Commerce service<\/a>, for example, everything from feed configuration to product data optimization and synchronization is managed for you.
