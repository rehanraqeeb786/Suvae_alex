The shop can be accessed through a business\u2019s Instagram profile, posts, or stories. Once in the storefront, your visitors can browse products, and collections and make purchases directly from your storefront thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/about.instagram.com\/blog\/announcements\/introducing-instagram-checkout?igb_blog_shops_launch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram\u2019s checkout<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram Shop helps streamline the process of posting posts and stories, encouraging viewers to visit your website or brick-and-mortar store.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7479\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Copy-of-Untitled.jpg\" alt=\"instagram-shop-and-ecommerce-products-set-up-11\" width=\"300\" height=\"574\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Users can use Instagram Shop to browse products based on categories, such as beauty or home decor.
