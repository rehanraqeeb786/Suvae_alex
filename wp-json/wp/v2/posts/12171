This includes your product listings in social commerce, marketplaces, shopping ads, and your website.<br \/>\nReaching this goal when you have many product listings and ads can be challenging but not impossible.<\/p>\n<h3>Possible reasons for a price mismatch error and Google\u2019s suggestions on how to fix it<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><i><strong>A sale has started or ended but the price in the feed hasn\u2019t been updated<\/strong>; as a result, the sale price effective date is wrong.<br \/>\nAdditionally, ensure the value for the<\/i> <i>sale price effective date [sale_price_effective_date]<\/i><i><i> attribute is aligned with the timing of changes to your site.<\/i><\/i><\/li>\n<li><i><i><strong>Multiple prices on the landing page<\/strong>: Shopping supports two prices, the price and the sale price (which are indicated using the price [price] and sale price [sale_price] attributes).<br \/>\nIf more than one price is present, make sure the lowest price is the most prominent and is listed using the sale price [sale_price] attribute.<\/i><\/i><\/li>\n<li><i><i><strong>Use of IP detection and dynamically changing prices<\/strong>: Don\u2019t change the price of your product on your landing page based on a user\u2019s location.<br \/>\nAdditionally, do not change the price based on cookies, browsers, devices, or any other factor. If you only target certain locations within a country, use regional pricing and availability.<\/i><\/i><\/li>\n<li><i><i><strong>Outdated microdata or HTML<\/strong>: Check for contradictory information within your site build, and remove it to eliminate crawling issues.<\/i><\/i><\/li>\n<li><i><i><strong>Minimum order quantity and bulk products<\/strong>: If the shopper must purchase a minimum number of products, such as 10, list the total price for 10 products.<br \/>\nDon\u2019t submit the price for a single product if a minimum number of products is required.<\/i><\/i><\/li>\n<li><i><i><strong>Title, description, or image mismatch<\/strong>: Make sure that the product featured in your title, description, and image matches the price you submit.<br \/>\nFor example, if the product description mentions \u201can engraved product\u201d and the image features a customized product with an engraving, make sure the price in the feed includes engraving fees.<\/i><\/i><\/li>\n<li><i><i><strong>Variant preselection and price ranges<\/strong>: Ensure each variant in the feed has a URL that loads to a pre-populated page of that variant.<br \/>\nFor example, if you advertise a premium flower bouquet, make sure the price in your feed is for the premium variant and the same premium variant is preselected on the landing page.<\/i><\/i><\/li>\n<li><i><i><strong>Handling fees<\/strong>: If you have additional logistical fees, rather than bundling them into the price variant, list them on the site as &#8220;shipping&#8221;, &#8220;delivery&#8221;, &#8220;handling&#8221;, &#8220;logistics&#8221;, or &#8220;carrier&#8221; and bundle the cost into the shipping [shipping] attribute.<\/i><\/i><\/li>\n<li><i><strong>Dynamic population and page load times<\/strong>: If a price is calculated dynamically and then added to the landing page, or if the page has a slow load time, the crawlers may miss the final price.

The price shouldn\u2019t increase at checkout, but it may be reduced after the product is added to the cart if a promotion is added.<\/i><\/i><\/i>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><i><i><i><strong>Any additional fees charged during checkout must be disclosed<\/strong> in Merchant Center by bundling them with the applicable shipping costs.<br \/>\nFor example, service fees, handling fees, carrier-related fees, and state fees must be included in the total value submitted in the shipping [shipping] attribute or using the Merchant Center shipping services.<\/i><\/i><\/i>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><i><i><i>Many countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, and Italy, require a <strong>value-added tax (VAT) which must be included<\/strong> in your price [price] attribute.<\/i><\/i><\/i>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><i><i><i>For the US, <strong>sales tax must be clearly stated in the feed attributes<\/strong> or your account-level settings.<br \/>\nOverestimating sales tax in Merchant Center is allowed, but taxes can\u2019t be higher at checkout than those listed in Merchant Center.<\/i><\/i><\/i>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><i><i><i><strong>Shipping costs are submitted separately,<\/strong> either in your feed or at the account level. Note that feed-level rates will override account-level settings.<br \/>\nYou can overestimate shipping rates in the Merchant Center as long as they&#8217;re not higher on your website at checkout.<\/i><\/i><\/i>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><i><i><i>If you require a minimum basket amount for a customer to qualify for free shipping, make sure to <strong>set up your shipping settings on the account level<\/strong> and use the &#8220;free shipping over a certain amount&#8221; option.<\/i><\/i><\/i>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><i>If you charge a minimum basket amount surcharge on top of the shipping cost, make sure the <strong>surcharge is included in your shipping settings<\/strong>.

This could happen if you haven\u2019t fixed your price mismatch issue within 28 days from receiving the notification in Google Merchant Center.<\/li>\n<li>Having too many products disapproved may also lead to a <strong>reduced number of offers available<\/strong> for a Google Shopping campaign.<\/li>\n<li>A shorter-term risk, but equally as serious as an account suspension, is providing a<strong> negative shopping experience to your customers<\/strong>. If Google doesn\u2019t catch mismatched values and a customer sees a different price on a shopping ad compared to your website, this could lead to fewer people clicking on your ads or completing a purchase on your website.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 id=\"03\">How to Use Google\u2019s Automatic Item Updates to Help Price Mismatch Issues<\/h3>\n<p>Google Ad\u2019s <b>Automatic Item Updates<\/b> are used to improve the quality of your data and provide a good user experience for shoppers.
