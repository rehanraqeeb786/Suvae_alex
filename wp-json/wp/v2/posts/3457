Figuring out what the disapprovals mean, why they are happening, and who to talk to can take years off your life. Follow this logical process and find a quick solution to get your products approved in Google Merchant Center (GMC).<\/p>\n<h2>Quick Guide to avoid disapproved products and get them approved<\/h2>\n<p>1. Export your GMC diagnostic report<br \/>\n2. Review the GMC issues systematically with your tech team and prioritize fixes<br \/>\n3. Update your product data to meet Google\u2019s specifications for each issue<br \/>\n4. Re-submit your product feed to GMC with the changes made to either your feed,<br \/>\nwebsite, or both.<br \/>\n5. Google will crawl your site and compare it to the information in your product feed<br \/>\nto resolve issues<br \/>\n6. You\u2019re done unless Google decides they don\u2019t like the changes you\u2019ve made.<\/p>\n<h2>What if GMC still disapproves of my products?<\/h2>\n<p>You think you\u2019ve made all of the necessary changes to get your products approved but then you go back to GMC, and there are still errors. Unfortunately, Google\u2019s approval process isn\u2019t a perfect science. That\u2019s when you start looking at how you can tweak individual product data. A variety of technical issues could raise a flag for Google. I\u2019m not going to lie, troubleshooting at this level can be tough and time-consuming.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>What if I am not able to make the changes necessary to get my products approved in GMC?<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some examples of disapprovals that may be very challenging to fix:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1.<\/strong> <strong>Item requires a GTIN<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s not an easy task to source product GTINs. You can go to the manufacturer or your merchandising team and speak with some people, and none of them will have an answer on how to get the codes. Keep trying! The numbers exist, you just need the right connection or method to source them.<br \/>\nIn some cases, products don\u2019t require GTINs. In this case, you can follow Google Merchant Center\u2019s documentation on how to label these products in your Google Shopping feed.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Invalid color name in attribute color<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Google is not a fan of complex color names. Your tech team can use a color mapping technique using look-up tables to standardize\u00a0product catalog colors\u00a0specifically for your \u00a0Google Shopping feed. \u00a0An example of this would be mapping &#8220;lilac&#8221; to &#8220;light purple&#8221;. Any instance of the product color \u201clilac\u201d would be automatically replaced with \u201clight purple\u201d for present and future products.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to multi-colored products, Google requires you to choose the dominant color. Finding the dominant color can be a painful and sometimes manual process that is necessary to get your products approved. Here are some tips from Google on what they\u2019re looking for when it comes to including multi-colored products in your feed.<\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Temporary item disapprovals due to incorrect prices.<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are selling products in more than one country, Google is going to expect your website to display the prices in the currency of that country. It may seem easy because you have a website that dynamically changes the currency to the IP address of the user. This\u00a0redirect method provides the user\u00a0with a good experience, but it doesn\u2019t allow a comparison of prices in your feed to the\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prices on your website. Google is looking for a unique URL for each country. For instance, if you use the same URL for the US as you do in the UK, Google will see a price discrepancy. Updating your website to fix this issue can be a lengthy and labor-intensive process, but it is not impossible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h5><strong>GOOGLE MERCHANT CENTER FORUM RE-POST<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><em><strong>QUESTION<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Hi, I have several items disallowed disapproved on Google Merchant. \u00a0When clicking on the error it says:<\/p>\n<p>Diagnostics<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Example: Uvex Classic Black Ladies Boot 9482<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Item ID: 1099<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sampled on Jan 06, 2015, 16:03:10 UTC<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Value in feed: 47.99GBP<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Value on the website: 69.94GBP<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Current status: Disapproved<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Input system: Feed Id:<\/span><\/li>\n<li>When I check on our website we have the 47.99 display (like the feed and 69.94 is nowhere). \u00a0How do I resolve this problem?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 16px;\"><strong>ANSWER<\/strong>:<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Many e-commerce shopping carts have a default currency (locale) that is made semi-permanent after a user selects a currency; this is also not allowed; the landing page must be identical for all users.<\/p>\n<p>The most common methods to correct the issue are to either use a separate link landing page or domain per target country or URL parameters to pre-select the appropriate country or currency;<\/p>\n<p>Also, the price submitted and on the landing page must include VAT..
