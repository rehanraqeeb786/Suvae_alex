Once inside, they\u2019ll find a vast assortment of merchandise carefully selected from some of their favorite brands. That\u2019s similar to the kind of experience Macy\u2019s wants to offer luxury shoppers online, as they explore the premium products curated for its digital marketplace.<\/p>\n<h2>About Macy\u2019s Marketplace<\/h2>\n<p>Featuring more than 20 product categories including beauty, wellness, and gifting,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.macysinc.com\/investors\/news-events\/press-releases\/detail\/1788\/macys-launches-its-curated-digital-marketplace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Macy\u2019s launched its digital marketplace<\/a> in the fall of 2022. This not only opens up access to would-be Macy\u2019s customers who live far beyond the Big Apple. It also creates incredible opportunities for sellers that make it part of their omnichannel marketing and sales strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Macy\u2019s has said it will offer sellers tools to monitor and drive customer activity to further their growth. On the front end, the retail giant said customers should expect a seamless experience as they shop, have products shipped, or when need to process returns.<\/p>\n<p>The launch of Macy\u2019s digital marketplace was closely followed by<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/bloomingdales-emperia-virtual-department-store-holidays\/637007\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> a similar initiative from Bloomingdale\u2019s, which debuted its own multi-brand eCommerce store<\/a> shortly before the holiday season.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Marketplace Customer Experience Matters<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-inside-post aligncenter wp-image-15045 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/macys-marketplace.jpg\" alt=\"Macys marketplace\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/macys-marketplace.jpg 750w, https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/macys-marketplace-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Retailers like Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s are part of a larger trend that is transforming the way brands are thinking about the best ways to reach customers and expand their volume of customer relationships. Since 2020, for instance,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.beshapingthefuture.co.uk\/insights\/online-marketplace-payments-to-hit-usd-8-7-trillion-by-2025\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> online marketplaces have made up 53% of business-to-consumer (B2C) online sales<\/a>. This has put the overall digital marketplace segment on a path to a projected $8.7 trillion in payments by 2025.<\/p>\n<p>Online marketplaces are powerful tools for retailers that want to embrace curation at scale, offering existing customers a greater assortment and expanded offerings to attract new customers. These same advantages benefit the sellers who participate in online marketplaces, but only if they execute effectively as they integrate with them.<\/p>\n<h2>What Marketplace Integrators are, and how they can help<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/multi-marketplace-integration-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Integrating with digital marketplaces<\/a> on your own can require significant in-house technology expertise. It also means taking your most talented technical professionals and putting them on a project that potentially takes them away from other opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Given the pace of change, meanwhile, there can be a significant effort to continue integrating with each new marketplace and understanding its particular needs.<\/p>\n<p>Third-party marketplace integration services provide the expertise and experience necessary to accelerate the process of selling properties from the likes of Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s. They also have more resources to stay ahead of the technology requirements of online marketplaces as they evolve.<\/p>\n<h2>Macy\u2019s Marketplace Integration made easy<\/h2>\n<p>At Highstreet, for example,<a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/marketplace-integration\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> marketplace integration services<\/a> include <strong>connecting sellers to properties<\/strong> like Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s and capturing customer orders. Suvae.org also manages processes such as the acknowledgment that an order has shipped, as well as data around product returns.<\/p>\n<p>Uploading<a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/inventory-management-tools-for-multichannel-ecommerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> inventory data<\/a> to the marketplace is fully automated, which <strong>saves sellers time and reduces the risk of errors<\/strong>. Instead of disappointing customers by promoting products that are no longer in stock, sellers can avoid high cancellation rates, which on some marketplaces can lead to penalties.<\/p>\n<p>A marketplace integration service like Suvae.org is also experienced in <strong>helping sellers with content mapping<\/strong>. This is the process of translating data about product colors, sizing, and pricing so they appear as the correct values on a marketplace such as Macy\u2019s or Bloomingdale\u2019s. When catalogs can contain hundreds or even thousands of products, it\u2019s critical to map content accurately to ensure a great shopping experience on sites like Macy\u2019s marketplace.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>Marketplace integrators have proven approaches to ensure high-quality results for digital sellers. This includes testing the connection between the seller\u2019s inventory and Suvae.org, for example, to ensure inventory is being updated at the right frequency and without mistakes on Macy\u2019s or Bloomingdale\u2019s, and that all orders are being properly captured. This is an important phase of the integration process that will<strong> put sellers in a better position to promote their products<\/strong> in these kinds of environments.<\/p>\n<p>As more premium retailers like Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s develop exceptional shopping destinations online, being ready to participate in digital marketplaces will become an essential element in successful eCommerce.<\/p>\n<p><em>Connect with us to learn more about<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/contact-us\/\"><em> how Suvae.org can help you master any marketplace with ease<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you step onto West 34th Street in New York City, there\u2019s no missing Macy\u2019s iconic flagship store, and experienced shoppers know exactly what to expect.
