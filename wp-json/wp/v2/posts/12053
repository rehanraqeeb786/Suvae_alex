With so many social commerce platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat to choose from, the options are endless.<\/p>\n<p>So why would you start selling on TikTok in addition to the other social channels you\u2019ve integrated with? The simple answer is massive reach and high engagement rates.<\/p>\n<p>Hootsuite reported that as of January 2022, TikTok is the most engaging social media app by far, with an average user session of 10.85 minutes. They have over 1 billion monthly active users worldwide and their ads reach 17.9% of all internet users age 18+.<\/p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, advertising on this platform is no longer an experiment for retailers. <strong>TikTok\u2019s annual revenue skyrocketed to 4.6 billion in 2021<\/strong> and it came in fifth for app lifetime consumer spending worldwide against big players like YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>So, how did TikTok increase its revenue so dramatically in such a short time period? Simply put, revenue from advertisers.<\/p>\n<p>In August of 2021, they partnered with Shopify to launch TikTok Shopping, a feature where users can shop while scrolling through videos or click on a business\u2019s profile and explore products in the Shopping Tab.<br \/>\nLater on, they launched Dynamic Showcase Ads to make it even easier for users to buy and retailers to advertise their products.<\/p>\n<p>Keep reading to find out more about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is it worth selling on TikTok?<\/li>\n<li>How do brands go viral on TikTok<\/li>\n<li>How to sell products on TikTok<\/li>\n<li>How to engage customers to sell more on TikTok<\/li>\n<li>Why using an optimized TikTok data feed helps you increase product visibility &amp; better campaign performance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Is it worth selling on TikTok?<\/h2>\n<p>The answer is yes. In recent years TikTok has expanded its audience beyond the under-20 crowds. During the COVID pandemic topics like DIY hacks, recipes, travel, health, beauty, and fashion began trending, which attracted a new demographic to the platform. Brands and retailers are now capitalizing on the opportunity to engage with this broader audience by coming up with a separate TikTok marketing strategy focused on the types of videos their audience likes to watch. Not to mention the new social commerce experience that brings in-app shopping and streamlined product discovery to the platform, allowing users to directly shop on TikTok without leaving the app.<\/p>\n<p><b>Some of the major benefits of selling on TikTok include:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive more brand awareness by developing a new and highly engaged audience<\/li>\n<li>Sell more products by showcasing them in organic posts and ads<\/li>\n<li>Stay relevant with your customers by participating in trends<\/li>\n<li>Create better content that leads to results by tracking your performance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Check out these 10 fashion brands to see how they master selling on TikTok:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@abercrombie?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@amazonfashion?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Fashion<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@ugg?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UGG<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@aritzia?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aritzia<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@levis?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Levi&#8217;s<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@target?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Target<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@skims?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skims<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@lululemon?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lululemon<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@zara?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zara<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@nike?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nike<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How do brands go viral on TikTok?<\/h2>\n<p>The options are endless when it comes to developing viral-worthy content but the key is being consistent and creative with your content.
