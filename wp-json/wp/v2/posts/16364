This is the time you should start looking at your big-ticket items and consider how best to promote them.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s when you develop ad campaigns with creative visuals that showcase your most attractive offers. And if you\u2019re serious about having a successful Black Friday, it\u2019s the moment you optimize your Amazon product data feed, too.<\/p>\n<p>While the company sells plenty of its own merchandise to eCommerce buyers, for example, as many as<a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/259782\/third-party-seller-share-of-amazon-platform\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 60% of paid units are sold on Amazon by third-party merchants<\/a> across a wide range of categories.<\/p>\n<p>The size of the marketplace indeed means there is plenty of competition on Amazon. However, the company continues to offer innovations that help other brands stand out. This includes<a href=\"https:\/\/www.retailtouchpoints.com\/topics\/digital-commerce\/amazon-inspire-shoppable-content-feed-discovery-immersive-experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> the \u201cInspire\u201d feed<\/a> introduced in late 2022, as well as<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/09\/14\/amazon-updates-visual-search-ar-search-and-more-in-challenge-to-google\/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAopAwc6S05QqiF6tx59ynRjjeBUlHoZxgFVPDyh7Z9mgcElKZRbY3YbWanzF3xmDZjmX5PvqKyyOE3zAUqBg_qbytNeeGsx5BySP_4MBE3vVukgpOzDzzzYkZlHa9p33petYoOtCAfbVhfMvhGna2gOJ-UleoqYW23WcOSPRIXr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> product discovery tools<\/a> based on augmented reality and<a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/using-visual-search\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> visual search<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>How to better list your products on Amazon Marketplace<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16372\" title=\"Listing Products on Amazon Marketplace\" src=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/amazon-list.jpg\" alt=\"Products on Amazon Marketplace\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Much like other online marketplaces,<a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/amazon-product-listings-all-you-need-to-know\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> getting products listed on Amazon<\/a> involves some basic steps.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to choose the appropriate product category,<a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/your-ultimate-guide-to-amazon-pricing-strategy-success\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> determine your pricing strategy<\/a>, select a<a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/amazon-fba-inventory-management\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> fulfillment<\/a> method, and use keywords Amazon visitors will likely key into the search bar.<\/p>\n<p>Some of these steps will involve some manual effort, but to scale effectively and maximize your eCommerce sales opportunities, you\u2019ll also want to harness the power of automation for your Amazon product data feeds.<\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of having an optimized Amazon product data feed<\/h2>\n<p>Amazon\u2019s marketplace customers have the same expectations as those who discover your brand through your website or any other channel. They want to see accurate product listings, up to date, and reflect what\u2019s available for purchase.<\/p>\n<p>As you begin to list more products on Amazon, however, maintaining the quality of your data can become incredibly difficult. Updating pricing, available inventory, and other aspects of hundreds of listings or more isn\u2019t a great use of employees\u2019 time.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond taking those chores away, the benefits of automating your Amazon product data feeds include:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Listings that do your products justice<\/h3>\n<p>When consumers walk into a physical store, you only get one chance to make a first impression. That\u2019s why retailers often put out their best products on a table or rack where discerning customers can notice all the key details.<\/p>\n<p>The same principle applies to online product listings. Your Amazon product data feed should be optimized to ensure you\u2019re providing everything from product titles, descriptions, and images that convert visitors into buyers.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Product information customers can trust<\/h3>\n<p>Without automation, an Amazon product data feed might only be updated once every few days. That poses a risk that customers will not realize the price of an item they\u2019re considering has changed, or that it\u2019s temporarily out of stock.<\/p>\n<p>Your goal should be to provide real-time updates that reflect the current state of every product in your inventory. That way, you can more easily offer promotions and discounts that drive more activity during periods like Black Friday.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Can\u2019t-miss visibility in Amazon search results<\/h3>\n<p>Much like when they\u2019re looking up information on Google, many consumers probably don\u2019t want to go past the first page of results when they\u2019re searching on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>When you put in the work upfront to research the right keywords, an Amazon product data feed will maximize the likelihood your items will rank higher than competitors. And of course, with its one-click buy button, Amazon makes it easy for customers to take the next step when they find what they want.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Access to a global market<\/h3>\n<p>Unlike the limitations of a physical storefront, eCommerce allows sellers to transcend borders and other geographic boundaries. This is especially true on Amazon, which enjoys<a href=\"https:\/\/www.blankspace.eu\/blog-posts-en\/amazon-marketplaces-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> billions in sales in markets such as the U.K., Germany, and Japan<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>No matter where they\u2019re based, though, your customers should have a consistent experience in terms of the level of detail and timeliness of the data in your listings. Automating your product feed on Amazon will ensure that, even if the same customer decides to browse across more than one Amazon regional site.<\/p>\n<h3>5. An end to constant inventory worries<\/h3>\n<p>It may sound like a nice problem to have, but when a product proves more popular than expected there can be more disappointed customers than those feeling satisfied. Running out of stock can hurt your reputation as a brand, both with customers and Amazon itself (more on that later in this post).<\/p>\n<p>Think of your product data feed as a trusted assistant who makes managing inventory levels both easy and efficient. Stock getting low? You can set an alert to be notified and take action before it\u2019s too late.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Out-price the competition<\/h3>\n<p>Depending on the product category, there may be little to truly differentiate your brand from your rivals, other than what you\u2019re asking customers to pay.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of treating this as a race to the bottom in terms of revenue, however, you can use Amazon\u2019s Repricing tool or your analytics to determine what will make the most sense for your business.<\/p>\n<p>Then, when you\u2019re ready, you can use your Amazon product data feed to get new prices up with speed, especially amid moments like Black Friday when you know there are likely a lot of people browsing the marketplace for a deal.<\/p>\n<h3>7. A stronger partnership with Amazon<\/h3>\n<p>Amazon has to manage a slew of seller relationships, and its priority is understandably to ensure its marketplace meets the highest quality standards.<\/p>\n<p>If your listings aren\u2019t properly formatted, for example, or are missing key attributes, it can jeopardize your brand\u2019s future in Amazon\u2019s marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>This is another example of where relying on manual, human effort doesn\u2019t make sense. A product data feed optimized for Amazon reduces the risk of errors. That not only means you\u2019ll avoid being suspended from Amazon\u2019s marketplace program; you could become one of its most trusted eCommerce partners.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Greater capabilities to execute data-driven decision-making<\/h3>\n<p>Amazon wants its sellers to share its customer-obsessed approach to eCommerce. That\u2019s why the company offers analytics tools that let them track their performance. Having the data is only the first step, though.<\/p>\n<p>As you get a better understanding of what\u2019s selling and why, you can begin to make tweaks to your listings that will supercharge your conversion rate. It might be adding more details to a single product listing, offering a promotion based on a possible best-seller or simply ensuring you hold onto the right level of inventory for seasonal products.<\/p>\n<h3>9. An accelerated path to eCommerce expansion<\/h3>\n<p>Creating an Amazon product data feed isn\u2019t an isolated IT project that takes up time and resources. It represents the beginning of a multi-channel sales strategy that can continue to offer dividends.<\/p>\n<p>With your product data optimized, for instance, you can begin to look at other digital channels that are likely to attract your target customers.<\/p>\n<p>This can include<a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/tiktok-product-feeds-for-stronger-ecommerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> social media channels like TikTok<\/a>, for instance, or even one of the growing number of online marketplaces being offered by brands that are already household names, such as<a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/unlock-the-potential-of-macys-marketplace-with-integration-services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>10. A customer experience that builds brand loyalty<\/h3>\n<p>Customers who initially discover your brand on Amazon\u2019s marketplace may decide to visit your website to learn more. They might pay greater attention when your products show up on Instagram or Facebook. Some will even opt-in to receive your e-mail newsletter for additional promotions and discounts.<\/p>\n<p>The product data feed you set up on Amazon will let you build a relationship with these customers based on a positive experience, where they find what they want and get it sent their way. When they\u2019re satisfied, it\u2019s not just Amazon that benefits \u2013 your brand will too.<\/p>\n<h2>How to create an Amazon product data feed<\/h2>\n<p>Setting up an Amazon product data field involves the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Open an Amazon seller central account so you have access to send your product data feed to the marketplace. You\u2019ll need to provide a credit card, tax identification information, and basic business information such as your business name, address, and contact details.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Link your business bank account to your brand\u2019s Amazon seller account.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Choose the local marketplaces Amazon operates that are most relevant to your business in terms of your target customers.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Choose your preferred billing plan \u2013 unless you\u2019re selling as an individual this will be a professional plan aimed at corporate entities for a nominal monthly fee.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Complete your tax interview \u2013 Amazon needs to verify the professional status of your business.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Enter basic product information \u2013 This is where you can clarify whether you\u2019re the manufacturer of the products you\u2019re selling or whether you\u2019re reselling on an OEM\u2019s behalf. You\u2019ll also quantify the volume of products you\u2019ll be selling on Amazon and whether or not you use UPC codes for your products.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\">Add all the necessary data attributes such as product title, category, SKU, price, images, and URL of each item. Don\u2019t forget critical details such as shipping costs if you\u2019re not using Amazon\u2019s fulfillment service. Be as detailed as possible to provide the best experience for Amazon customers.<\/li>\n<li>Upload your inventory file: Within your Amazon seller account you\u2019ll visit the inventory page and deliver the content in either text or XML format.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Be prepared to make changes to this feed as you manage your stock levels, customer demand, and many other factors.<\/p>\n<h2>Managing your Amazon product data feed with Suvae.org<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s no need to tackle the complications of setting up an Amazon product data feed on your own.
