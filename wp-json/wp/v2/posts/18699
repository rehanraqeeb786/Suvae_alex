Online marketplaces represent a huge opportunity to reach a much larger addressable market and grow revenues, but it\u2019s important to choose carefully.<\/p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/selling-on-luxury-fashion-marketplace\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">luxury fashion retailers<\/a>, for instance, the best way to ensure near-term return on investment (ROI) is to identify online marketplaces that:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n<li>Specialize in clothing, footwear and accessories, where consumers are actively browsing for products like yours.<\/li>\n<li>Has established a proven track record in driving traffic and engagement with consumers<\/li>\n<li>Offers partnership programs with reasonable terms and enticing seller benefits.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Asos and Zalando: Two specialists in online fashion sales<\/h2>\n<p>Asos and Zalando are perfect examples of digital destinations that meet these criteria. Both have attracted a considerable number of sellers and\u00a0 have successfully expanded their portfolios in order to satisfy consumer demand.<\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s possible to integrate with multiple marketplaces simultaneously, many eCommerce strategies involve starting with one. That way you can test the waters in terms of how you promote products on a third-party marketplace and adapt to any rules that have been put in place.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, here\u2019s a rundown Asos vs Zalando and how they compare from an online\u00a0 marketplace perspective:<\/p>\n<h2>Why choose Asos marketplace<\/h2>\n<p>For nearly 25 years, the name \u201cAsos\u201d has become almost synonymous with fast fashion, particularly among younger online shoppers. The company\u2019s success with its own affordable but stylish apparel and accessories has led to several strategic acquisitions, such as Topshop.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, the Asos marketplace has allowed the brand to significantly expand the selection of products it offers. This not only includes new products but vintage collections, which can be appealing to those focused on sustainability through reuse.<\/p>\n<p>These are the Asos marketplace numbers you need to know:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n<li>Market share:<a href=\"https:\/\/pitchbook.com\/profiles\/company\/54275-95#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 45% of Asos\u2019s sales come from its home market in the U.K.<\/a>, followed by 30% of other European countries. It also has significant sales from the U.S.<\/li>\n<li>Average customer: More than<a href=\"https:\/\/www.similarweb.com\/website\/asos.com\/#demographics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 33% of Asos visitors are between the ages of 25 and 24<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Brand scope: Asos manages 13 of its own brands and offers more than 900 others through the Asos marketplace.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Why choose Zalando marketplace<\/h2>\n<p>Selling shoes online was just the first step for the Zalando marketplace. Today the company is a viable online shopping destination for everything from evening gowns to handbags. It is also broadening the scope of its business model, investing in products and capabilities to support business-to-business (B2B) as well as its traditional consumer audience. Its more recent innovations include<a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.zalando.com\/en\/technology\/zalando-launches-size-recommendations-based-customers-own-body-measurements\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> a digital tool to predict sizing<\/a> based on photos submitted by its customers.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how Zalando stacks up by the numbers:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n<li><b>Market share<\/b>: Zalando commands about<a href=\"https:\/\/pitchbook.com\/profiles\/company\/53796-70#:~:text=Zalando%20General%20Information&amp;text=The%20company%20commands%20around%2012,the%20firm%20has%20a%20presence).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 12% of Europe\u2019s overall sales for apparel products<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><b>Average customer<\/b>: More than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.similarweb.com\/website\/zalando.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">27% of Zalando\u2019s visitors fall between the ages of 25-34<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><b>Brand scope<\/b>: More than 7,000 brands are available in the Zalando marketplace<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Beyond these basic figures, it\u2019s important to consider the policies online marketplace operators have in place to support sellers. Asos doesn\u2019t charge a commission to list products, for instance, and you\u2019re able to upload your entire catalog. Zalando, meanwhile, offers marketing services to help brands advertise on its marketplace as well as a distribution and fulfillment arm.<\/p>\n<h2>Asos vs Zalando: The bottom line<\/h2>\n<p>In the end, both the Asos marketplace and the Zalando marketplace create opportunities for growing brands to find new customers and increase their revenues. Getting started with either, however, depends on effectively managing your product feeds.<\/p>\n<p>Once approved in each company\u2019s partner program, you\u2019ll need to be able to seamlessly transfer data from your product catalogs directly to either marketplace. As you make changes to pricing, product content or introduce new promotions, your feeds will need to remain accurate and up to date. That\u2019s why Suvae.org offers marketplace integrations for <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/asos-integration\/\">Asos<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/zalando-integration\/\">Zalando <\/a>and dozens of others.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Expanding your eCommerce sales beyond your brand\u2019s own web site is a big decision.
