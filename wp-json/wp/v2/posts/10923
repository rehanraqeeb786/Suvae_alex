The answer is an absolute yes.<\/p>\n<p>The rise of digital marketplaces, social media shopping, and eCommerce continues to drive increased demand for popular brands to make their products available through social media marketplaces.<br \/>\nThis exact reason led Facebook to create a Facebook Shop for eCommerce businesses looking to create online storefronts through Facebook and Instagram. With mobile eCommerce expected to reach a $3.56 trillion value in 2021, it\u2019s clear why this is the focus today. Facebook Shop is free to use, allowing companies to add their products to the most popular social networks available.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s dive into the benefits of a Facebook Shop for your international brand,\u00a0 how a Facebook Shop differs from an Instagram Shop, and examples of both in practice.<\/p>\n<h2>Facebook Shop Benefits: The 6 Cs<\/h2>\n<h2><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10927\" style=\"color: #666666; font-size: 14px;\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/head-Benefits-of-Facebook2.jpg\" alt=\"The Benefits of Facebook Shops For Global Brands &amp; Retailers\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" \/><\/h2>\n<p>Launching your storefront with Shops is one of the best steps you can take to boost your chance of success. Why? The platform offers several features that brands and retailers will be interested in.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Complete Customization<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10929\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Facebook-Shops-Customization.jpg\" alt=\"The Benefits of Facebook Shops For Global Brands &amp; Retailers\" width=\"700\" height=\"292\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You have <strong>complete control over what your storefront will look like online<\/strong>. Tweak the colors, graphics, typefaces, buttons, and general layout to match how you want your brand image to look.<br \/>\nBest of all, even marketers with little design or technical experience can take advantage of the platform\u2019s easy-to-use tools. You even get a mobile preview on the side for instant feedback.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Collections<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10930\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Facebook-Shops-Collection.jpg\" alt=\"The Benefits of Facebook Shops For Global Brands &amp; Retailers\" width=\"700\" height=\"233\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Easily manage what products you want to show<\/strong> off the most. No matter how many different items you need to juggle, keep them organized through Collections, a feature for effectively cataloging your products.<\/p>\n<p>Just head to the Shops customization page, go to \u201clayout,\u201d and click \u201cadd collection\u201d to get started. Collections work best when you have a lineup of related products released together, such as a summer collection or a \u201cback to school\u201d sale.<br \/>\nCollections themselves just look pretty and can catch the eyes of passing visitors with their beautiful imagery and design.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Convenient Communication<\/h3>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 22px;\">\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10936\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/head-Benefits-of-Facebook4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/head-Benefits-of-Facebook4.png 389w, https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/head-Benefits-of-Facebook4-228x300.png 228w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>Facebook Shop is connected to major social networks, with <strong>access to communication tools like WhatsApp and Messenger for direct responses to customer questions and comments.<\/strong><br \/>\nThis real-time nature of your conversations will boost customer retention, and enhance your ability to provide personalized experiences.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>4. Custom Audiences<\/h3>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 22px;\">\n<p>Just like any online storefront, advertising and how you reach the right shoppers to <strong>maximize engagement<\/strong> are extremely important. In a nutshell, everyone who\u2019s ever viewed or bought products from you or otherwise showed some sort of interest gets grouped into your own Custom Audience.<\/p>\n<p>You have a chance to re-target these people for advertising with an option to filter based on certain demographic traits like location, age, and gender.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>5. Compatibility with eCommerce Tools<\/h3>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 22px;\">\n<p>To help you navigate the lucrative but also complicated world of online commerce, several third-party market integration tools are available to businesses today. Facebook is working with <strong>multiple partners to integrate your products with Facebook Shop<\/strong>, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Highstreet.io<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li>WooCommerce<\/li>\n<li>Shopify<\/li>\n<li>Channel Advisor<\/li>\n<li>Feedonomics<\/li>\n<li>And various others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Marketing and selling products on Facebook Shop is all about using the right tools and taking advantage of the <strong>massive audience<\/strong> you have with Facebook and Instagram.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>6. Collecting Insights and Analytics<\/h3>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 22px;\">\n<p>Detailed analytics are extremely valuable to eCommerce companies, as they provide <strong>actionable insights into your sales and products<\/strong>. Facebook and Instagram have a built-in Insights feature within the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/713927982072352?id=1077620002609475&amp;ref=fb4b_shops_products\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Commerce Manager<\/a>. From there, you can find data regarding:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visitor traffic, both how much and where they are coming from<\/li>\n<li>Demographic of your target market<\/li>\n<li>Tagged content<\/li>\n<li>Catalog insights<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also view <strong>statistics based on your needs,<\/strong> according to a date range, or by the site (either only Facebook or only Instagram).<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Facebook Shop vs Marketplace<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook Shop and Facebook Marketplace are indeed distinct features provided by Facebook, and they serve different purposes with their unique functionalities.<br \/>\nHere&#8217;s a brief comparison:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Facebook Shop:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Purpose:<\/strong> Facebook Shop is a feature designed for businesses and brands to set up an online storefront on their Facebook Page or Instagram profile. It allows businesses to showcase their products and services in a more organized and branded way.<\/li>\n<li><strong>E-commerce:<\/strong> It enables businesses to list products, provide product details, and pricing, and link directly to their website for purchasing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Customization:<\/strong> You can customize the look and feel of your shop to align with your brand&#8217;s identity.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Payments:<\/strong> Customers can make purchases through integrated payment systems, and you can manage orders within Facebook.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Business Insights:<\/strong> Provides access to business insights and analytics to help track the performance of your shop.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Facebook Marketplace:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Purpose:<\/strong> Facebook Marketplace is designed for individuals to buy and sell products locally within their community. It&#8217;s a platform for users to list items for sale or browse items for purchase.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Local Transactions:<\/strong> It focuses on local transactions, and you can filter listings based on location and category.<\/li>\n<li><strong>User-to-User Sales:<\/strong> Typically used for peer-to-peer sales, such as selling used items, furniture, electronics, and more.<\/li>\n<li><strong>No E-commerce Integration:<\/strong> Unlike Facebook Shop, Marketplace doesn&#8217;t provide a platform for businesses to create a branded storefront or integrate e-commerce functionalities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Communication:<\/strong> Buyers and sellers can communicate through Facebook Messenger to arrange transactions and meetings.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Facebook Shop is more suitable for businesses and brands looking to establish an online store presence, while Facebook Marketplace is oriented toward local, person-to-person transactions. The choice between the two depends on your goals and whether you are an individual looking to buy or sell used items locally or a business looking to showcase and sell products to a broader online audience.<\/p>\n<h2>Facebook Shop vs Instagram Shop<\/h2>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 22px;\">\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10932\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/head-Benefits-of-Facebook3.jpg\" alt=\" Facebook Shops Benefits vs. Instagram Shops Benefits\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What are the different benefits of selling on Facebook Shop as opposed to Instagram Shops? Here are three main differences:<\/p>\n<h3>Market Availability<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook has a broad global presence, so it&#8217;s accessible to a wide range of markets. However, certain features and functionalities within Facebook Shop, such as payment options and integration with local shipping providers, might be more limited in some regions.<\/p>\n<p><a style=\"font-size: 14px;\" href=\"https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/help\/instagram\/321000045119159\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram Shops is available in select markets<\/a><span style=\"color: #666666; font-size: 14px;\">.\u00a0 <\/span>Instagram has a large international user base, and the Shop feature is designed to cater to businesses targeting Instagram&#8217;s global audience. Like Facebook Shop, the availability of specific features and payment options in Instagram Shop can vary by region, as it depends on local regulations and partnerships.<br \/>\nBoth Facebook and Instagram checkout is only available in the United States<\/p>\n<h3>Product Display<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram has a unique way of organizing the product. The Shops section pulls together multiple product recommendations based on browsing history, and places them into a central location known as \u201cProducts For You\u201d.This allows users to easily navigate, as they&#8217;re on a small touchscreen device like a mobile. Facebook doesn\u2019t have this feature.<\/p>\n<p>In summary, Facebook Shop offers more flexibility in terms of product organization, customization, and the use of rich media content, while Instagram Shops are designed to be highly visual and mobile-friendly, with an emphasis on product tagging in organic content.<\/p>\n<h3>Setup<\/h3>\n<p>The setup process is slightly different between the two platforms. The main differences between setting up a Facebook Shop and an Instagram Shop are as follows:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Platform and Interface:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Facebook Shop:<\/strong> To set up a Facebook Shop, you need a Facebook Page for your business. You manage and configure your shop through Facebook&#8217;s Commerce Manager. This provides a more comprehensive set of tools and options for product management and customization.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Instagram Shop:<\/strong> To create an Instagram Shop, you need an Instagram Business or Creator account, and it should be linked to a Facebook Page. You set up and manage your shop directly on Instagram, and it primarily focuses on the visual presentation of your products within the Instagram app.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>2. Catalog Creation and Management:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Facebook Shop:<\/strong> You create and manage your product catalog within Facebook&#8217;s Commerce Manager. This catalog includes detailed information about your products, pricing, availability, and customization options for categorization and organization.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Instagram Shop:<\/strong> You can create and manage your product catalog directly within Instagram or sync it with an existing catalog from Facebook&#8217;s Commerce Manager. Instagram&#8217;s catalog is typically more streamlined, with a focus on visuals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>3. Payment Processing:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Facebook Shop:<\/strong> You need to set up payment processing options through Facebook to accept payments for products in your Facebook Shop. Various payment methods like PayPal and Stripe can be integrated.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Instagram Shop:<\/strong> Instagram facilitates the checkout process for customers within the app. Users can make purchases without leaving Instagram, and you&#8217;ll need to set up payment options specifically through Instagram Shopping.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>4. Customization:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Facebook Shop:<\/strong> Facebook Shops offer more extensive customization options for your shop&#8217;s appearance. You can add banner images, create product collections, and highlight featured products. This allows for a more tailored shopping experience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Instagram Shop:<\/strong> Instagram Shops have a more streamlined interface and are more focused on visual presentation. Product descriptions are typically shorter, and the emphasis is on the visual appeal of the products.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>5. Tagging Products:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Facebook Shop:<\/strong> While you can set up a Facebook Shop, it doesn&#8217;t have the same product tagging feature as Instagram. However, you can integrate your Facebook Shop with your Instagram account, enabling product tagging in Instagram posts and stories.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Instagram Shop:<\/strong> Instagram Shops are designed for seamless product tagging. You can tag your products in Instagram posts, stories, and IGTV videos, allowing users to view product details and make purchases within the Instagram app.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/268860861184453?id=1077620002609475\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook\u2019s official documentation<\/a> to read the full details.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Setting Up a Facebook Shop<\/h2>\n<p>Creating a Facebook Shop involves several steps.
