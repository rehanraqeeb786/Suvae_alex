But how exactly do you get the right products to show up in the appropriate ads in the correct location? The most popular question we get from clients on this topic is &#8220;how do we set up our Facebook catalogs with our Facebook product feeds?&#8221; Keep reading to find out the details in the 5 easy steps process.<\/p>\n<h2>Facebook Product Catalogs Set Up<\/h2>\n<p>Describing how to set up Facebook Product Catalogs is easy. Facebook Business Manager states \u201cA catalog is a container that holds information about the items in your inventory\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The catalog is connected to your product sets used for ads. Because Catalogs, Product Feeds (data sources), and Product Sets are all tied together, we\u2019re going to review all 3 topics so you can feel confident your ads will contain the RIGHT products. Let&#8217;s go through this process, step-by-step.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Get Started with Marketing Objectives<\/h3>\n<p>Catalog setup starts when you create an Ad campaign in Facebook Ad Manager. A pop-up screen appears where you choose your campaign\u2019s purpose under \u201cConversion\u201d.<br \/>\nChoose the Conversion Type \u201cCatalog Sales\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5673\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/FB-Ad-Manager-Marketing-Objective.png\" alt=\"FB-Ad-Manager-Marketing-Objective\" width=\"474\" height=\"238\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Create your Campaign<\/h3>\n<p>The second step is to create a campaign name and decide which catalog to use as a data source for your ads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5675\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/FB-Catalog-Sales-Catalog-Selection.jpg\" alt=\"FB-Catalog-Sales-Catalog-Selection\" width=\"570\" height=\"517\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If the catalog field is NOT already pre-populated in the drop-down menu, you need to add one in <a href=\"https:\/\/business.facebook.com\/products\/\">Catalog Manager <\/a><\/p>\n<p>Click <strong style=\"color: #666666; font-size: 14px;\">&#8220;Create new catalog&#8221;<\/strong><span style=\"color: #666666; font-size: 14px;\"> at the bottom of your catalog list. If there are no catalogs, Facebook will prompt you to create one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5676\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/FB-Create-New-Catalog-in-Business-Manager.jpg\" alt=\"https:\/\/business.facebook.com\/products\/\" width=\"580\" height=\"329\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Create a Catalog<\/h3>\n<p>First, select \u201cE-commerce\u201d as the business category.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5677\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/FB-Select-Business-Catagory-For-Catalog.jpg\" alt=\"FB-Select-Business-Catagory-For-Catalog\" width=\"397\" height=\"395\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Select <strong>\u201cUpload Product Info<\/strong>\u201d to upload a product feed. We\u2019re going to focus on companies that are using feeds and not connecting directly to an eCommerce Platform.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5678\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/FB-How-To-Add-Products-To-Catalog.jpg\" alt=\"FB-How-To-Add-Products-To-Catalog\" width=\"437\" height=\"384\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Your business name should appear in the business dropdown and this is where you <strong>name your Catalog<\/strong>. The catalog is just a container with various data sources.<br \/>\nThe best practice is to use a <strong>naming convention such as \u201cbrand-market\u201d<\/strong>. This naming convention easily conveys which data source should be assigned to a campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Once you hit next, your catalog container has been created and is displayed in the top left of the screen under \u201cCurrent Catalog\u201d. Now you need to fill it with products.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5679\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screen_Shot_2019-10-07_at_1_53_07_PM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"601\" height=\"301\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Go to \u201cProduct Data Sources\u201d in the left navigation and click the blue \u201cAdd Products\u201d button.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5681\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/FB-Product-Data-Source-Add-Products.jpg\" alt=\"FB-Product-Data-Source-Add-Products\" width=\"596\" height=\"220\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This part is where many people get confused. Keep reading to get more details and answers.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4 &#8211; Configure your Product Data Source<\/h3>\n<p>There are two options to configure the data source.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Upload your data source manu<\/strong><strong>ally\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Set an automatic file upload schedule (this is the one we use with our clients)<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5682\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/FB-Product-Catalog-Select-Upload-Method.jpg\" alt=\"FB-Product-Catalog-Select-Upload-Method\" width=\"552\" height=\"277\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Set Automatic File Upload Schedule<\/h4>\n<p>When you select this option more fields appear below. Use a product feed as your data source. How do you do this?<br \/>\nAdd the URLs and passwords for your product feeds. If you don\u2019t have your URLs and passwords and you are using a feed provider, request this information for each of your feeds.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5683\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/FB-Set-Automated-File-Upload-Schedule.jpg\" alt=\"FB-Set-Automated-File-Upload-Schedule\" width=\"478\" height=\"432\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you need your feed provider to be able to attach the feeds to your catalogs, you might be asking yourself the following questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> &#8220;How do I grant my feed provider access to my Facebook Ads Manager?&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Answer:<\/strong> Provide access to your feed partner in your Facebook Ads Manager settings by following these steps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the \u201cAssign Partner\u201d tab and grant access to the company<\/li>\n<li>That company can provide access to the appropriate individuals by clicking on \u201cAdd People\u201d<\/li>\n<li>All the feed partner needs is the list of catalogs they can attach their correlating feed to<\/li>\n<li>If you\u2019re not able to provide the feed company access, source the URL, Username &amp; Password from them to add the feed yourself<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5684\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/FB-Give-Partner-Access-To-Assets.jpg\" alt=\"FB-Give-Partner-Access-To-Assets\" width=\"533\" height=\"267\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How do I attach the Data Sources (Feeds) myself to a Catalog?<br \/>\n<\/strong><strong>Answer:<\/strong> As a representative of your company, you can add data sources (feeds) to the catalogs you\u2019ve set up.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the appropriate catalog and follow Facebook\u2019s instructions.<\/li>\n<li>Every catalog needs to have a feed URL with a username and password to access the feed from the provider.<\/li>\n<li>The best practice is to have 1 catalog per market. For example, you would have a separate catalog and corresponding feed for each country.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Step 5 &#8211; Configure your Product Sets<\/h3>\n<p>Now it\u2019s time to create your product sets to determine the products that will be used in your Facebook Dynamic Product Ads.<\/p>\n<p>You need to name your Product Set and then define your rules according to various parameters in a drop-down list. Once you\u2019ve defined the type of parameter then you can tell Facebook what to do with it in the example below.<\/p>\n<p>You can add multiple product sets in this section.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5685\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/FB-Create-A-Product-Set.jpg\" alt=\"FB-Create-A-Product-Set\" width=\"390\" height=\"309\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The rest of the campaign setup is specific to your marketing goals.
