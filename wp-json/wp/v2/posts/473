To get the most out of your investment, one of the most important aspects to consider is the quality of your product feed. By maintaining a high-quality data feed you can make sure the correct information about the right products is always in front of your customers, at the right time.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a list of <a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/product-feed-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data feed optimization<\/a> tips to improve your product feeds and get the most out of your PPC campaigns.<\/p>\n<h2>5 ways to optimize product feeds for better PPC Performance<\/h2>\n<h3>1. Ensure correct data feed configuration<\/h3>\n<p>Most service providers have specific requirements for the composition of the product feeds that they receive.<\/p>\n<p>Merchants must deliver their product feeds in the appropriate format to ensure effective campaigns. If your product feeds are not correctly configured, at best you will significantly reduce the return on your ad spend, at worst you risk having your feed rejected.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Accurate product data feed<\/h3>\n<p>OK, this one\u2019s obvious but we couldn\u2019t leave it out. You need to make sure that the information you have in your product feed accurately matches the information that you have on your eCommerce product page.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine you are shopping online and have just found the perfect product on a comparison site. You click through to buy and find out that the product image is different, the price is different, or worse, you are taken to the home page of the eCommerce store rather than the relevant product page.<\/p>\n<p>It is safe to say that you\u2019re probably less likely to buy the product. So you need to make sure the product data on your site is accurately reflected in your product feed if you want to streamline the customer experience and maximize conversions.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Up-to-date information<\/h3>\n<p>Closely related to the previous point, it\u2019s imperative to keep your feed up to date to maintain accuracy.<\/p>\n<p>The price and availability of your products are continually changing so you need to make sure that this is reflected in your product feed.<br \/>\nIf you are paying for a click-through to your product page and the product is no longer available, you are wasting your money and your customers\u2019 time.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Suppress poor-performing products<\/h3>\n<p>To get the most out of your ad spend, you need to keep an eye on how individual products are performing across each of the feeds you distribute.<\/p>\n<p>Poor-performing products are those that attract clicks but convert poorly. These need to be identified and removed from the feed as they are using up valuable ad spend that would be better used promoting higher-converting products.<br \/>\nMake sure you identify poor-performing products and either remove them from your feed or reduce the PPC bid.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Promote high performers<\/h3>\n<p>High-performing products are those that not only attract a high amount of clicks but also have a high conversion rate. It makes sense to try to get these products in front of more customers more often. You can do this by increasing the bids on these products to give them better visibility.<\/p>\n<p>Correct feed configuration, accurate product data, and up-to-date knowledge of what is selling or not help you maximize sales and a way to better optimize your ROI.<\/p>\n<p>By staying on top of these five points, you will increase your chances for the best return on your ad spend from your PPC campaigns. <a title=\"Product Feed Management made easy\" href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\">Highstreet.io<\/a> platform can help you automate many of these processes,\u00a0 ensuring your product feeds are optimized to attract more, and better-qualified, customers to your website. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/contact-us\/\">Contact us for more information.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are many ways you can increase traffic to your eCommerce websites with product feeds.
