The onboarding process can be tricky for sellers because of steps like product cataloging and activating references. These tasks can be extremely time-consuming, especially when your product data is located in various sources.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a way to onboard marketplaces quickly and effectively!<br \/>In this post, we\u2019ll take a look at the features, techniques, and requirements you need to effectively onboard online marketplaces. You&#8217;ll learn how to overcome common challenges with <strong>marketplace integration,<\/strong> and get <strong>order management<\/strong> tips to seamlessly showcase your products in front of more qualified customers.<\/p>\n<h2>Steps to consider when onboarding a marketplace<\/h2>\n<p>Before you begin to integrate a marketplace, there are a few things to consider.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Creating a Seller Account<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Of course, you will need to set up an account, starting with inputting all of the key information for security and verification, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) or Know Your Business (KYB). You may also need to submit specific documentation that allows the marketplace to verify the I.D. of you, the seller.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Product Cataloging &amp; Activation<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">This is a large part of the process, where the marketplace utilizes its rich product data from various sources to display your product feeds accurately. To have this properly set up, you\u2019ll need to make sure the data you submit for your feeds is up-to-date and detailed. The criteria in which a marketplace uses the data can vary quite drastically depending on which marketplace you are onboarding. Some marketplaces, like <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/what-sellers-need-to-know-about-amazon-product-feed-integration\/\">Amazon, can be particular with their integration criteria<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Customer Relationship Management<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Customer retention and loyalty are synonymous with your dispute management and resolution. Before integrating a certain marketplace, it\u2019s a good idea to set up a dispute management process and to understand how a specific marketplace will mediate if a resolution can\u2019t be achieved.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Financial Management<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">It\u2019s always beneficial to determine and fully understand the commission rates attributed to a given marketplace per sale and proactively map out an invoicing process. Again, a leading technology partner with a robust solution is key to having this (and the previous steps) taken care of to avoid headaches or confusion later on throughout the process.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Order Workflow Management<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The goal is to achieve an integrated fulfillment process, eliminating the need to use various marketplaces to ship products to customers manually. This can be a difficult task, especially with high order volumes. However, by working with a leading technical partner, this stage can be managed automatically, freeing up your time to focus on your store&#8217;s marketing instead of the back-end work.<\/p>\n<h2>The importance of order management<\/h2>\n<p>Order management is a crucial part of the entire eCommerce process and deals largely with the specific actions involved in successfully getting your products into the hands of your customers.<br \/>This can range from things such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warehousing and physical storage space<\/li>\n<li>Unified management of the order life cycle<\/li>\n<li>Secure and broadband connections for reliable product delivery<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With a sophisticated and well-rounded order management system in place, you can ensure that the entire shopping experience, from browsing to receipt of goods, is unparalleled. The experience your customers have should strengthen your overall brand positioning and reputation.<\/p>\n<h2>Common challenges with marketplace onboarding and how to overcome them<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re now one step closer to successful integration.
