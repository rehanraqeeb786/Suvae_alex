They also want an easy way to discover the best deals.<\/p>\n<p>For the brands, meanwhile, an easier approach to addressing those needs allows you to grow. The business case for data feed management, therefore, is a pretty easy one to make.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the ongoing concerns about the state of the global economy, for example, recent data suggests consumer spending online shows no signs of slowing down.<br \/>\nIn the U.S. alone<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.adobe.com\/en\/publish\/2022\/11\/10\/adobe-analytics-early-holiday-spending-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> there was a more than 10% increase in eCommerce activity totaling US$72 billion<\/a> in October. Some categories are seeing buying activity skyrocket, such as a 142% jump in outerwear apparel.<\/p>\n<p>According to other research, however,<a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/state-of-ecommerce-pandemic\/#toc-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> the surge in eCommerce sales comes with new challenges<\/a>. These not only include supply chain woes but also the cost to acquire and keep customers.<br \/>\nThat may be because brands have to balance providing the best products at the best price while ensuring they show up in all the myriad channels their target customers might be browsing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Data feed management technology<\/strong> speaks directly to these eCommerce hurdles and is the best way to begin overcoming them.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Data Feed Management?<\/h2>\n<p>By facilitating the distribution and management of product listings, <strong>data feed management helps online sellers<\/strong> transform everything from how they monitor their inventory to the level of personalized advertising they can bring to their customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>The<b> best data feed management platform<\/b> should not only <b>allow you to populate all the necessary digital channels with your product listings<\/b> but also synchronize them to ease the process of updating or making changes to them.<\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of Data Feed Optimization<\/h2>\n<p>Why is data optimization important? Because you never get a second chance to make a first impression \u2013 including the impression you make with a digital ad.<\/p>\n<p>When consumers type a search into Google, for instance, they may only spend a few seconds deciding whether the ad that comes up in response is worth a click.<br \/>\nThe quality of the elements that make up that ad \u2013 the title, the description, the price, the category, and the availability are just some of the factors that will convince them to buy from you, one way or the other.<\/p>\n<p>Providing that data can vary significantly from one digital channel to the next. This can mean considerable work for those behind the scenes to tailor product feeds for every affiliate network, marketplace, or comparison site available to them.<\/p>\n<h2>How Product Data Feeds can help<\/h2>\n<p><b>Optimizing product data feeds puts you in a position to sell anywhere your customers are<\/b> searching for their next purchase. Instead of worrying about the unique requirements for each channel, data feed management allows you to <strong>focus on creating ads that are more creative and compelling<\/strong> to entice a greater number of purchases.<\/p>\n<p>Creating product data feeds can also avoid manually exporting your product catalog and creating a disconnect between the products customers want and <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/inventory-management-tools-for-multichannel-ecommerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what you have in stock<\/a>.<br \/>\nThe greater consumers\u2019 confidence in the accuracy of your listings, the more likely they will reward you with repeat business.<\/p>\n<h2>Product Data Feed Management tools for better listings<\/h2>\n<p>Listing your products across a variety of digital channels is a way of ensuring you\u2019ve left no stone unturned.<\/p>\n<p>While<a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalcommerce360.com\/article\/us-ecommerce-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Amazon accounts for an estimated 40% of eCommerce activity<\/a>, for example, that leaves a significant percentage of other channels and <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/online-marketplaces-usa-expand-ecommerce-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketplaces where opportunities abound<\/a>. This is especially true for luxury brands that want to take an international approach to market to the most discerning, high-net-worth consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Besides marketplaces, connecting to your total addressable market could mean <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/reach-customers-social-commerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pursuing social commerce<\/a> on channels such as Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok.
