Growing your eCommerce requires being equally vigilant about all the most promising sales and marketing channels as they emerge. Connected TV advertising is a great example, especially when you combine it with the power of Google Promotions.<\/p>\n<p>Why connected TV advertising? Let\u2019s start with the fact that it\u2019s where a growing number of consumers are choosing to spend their leisure time.\u00a0 According to data from ComScore, for example,<a href=\"https:\/\/martech.org\/ctv-viewing-hours-rise-21\/\"> connected TV viewing rose 21%<\/a> in May of 2023 compared with the same period the year before.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, the competition for viewers\u2019 attention is also on the rise. One forecast suggests that CTV ad<a href=\"https:\/\/www.insiderintelligence.com\/content\/connected-tv-ctv-ad-revenue-growth-what-s-behind-surge\"> spending will grow more than 10% between now and 2028<\/a>. It\u2019s not just the large numbers of people watching. Connected TV ads are reaching a highly engaged audience that can be targeted in increasingly sophisticated ways.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re trying to make some last-minute marketing investments amid the holiday season \u2013 or simply trying to sell off excess inventory in January and beyond \u2013 using Google Promotions and CTV ads could be a smart idea.<\/p>\n<h2>How do Google promotions work with connected TV advertising?<\/h2>\n<p>The business case for using Google Promotions has been firmly established by now. It\u2019s an effective way to distribute product offers across multiple Google properties, including the Shopping tab, Chrome and Search.<a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/build-brand-drive-sales-google-merchant-promotions\/\"> Mastering Google Promotions<\/a> can allow you to compare multi-screen traffic, increase conversions and boost your marketing campaigns\u2019 click through rate (CTR), all while building your brand.<\/p>\n<p>Google has made it easy to <b>extend your reach with connected TV ads<\/b>, particularly based on audiences you\u2019ve already developed through visitors to your web site or those who have downloaded your mobile app. The basic process is as follows:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u00a0 Log into Google Merchant Center and opt to build a campaign using Display and Video 360.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0 Select a first-party data audience list.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0 Add the audience list to your insertion order or line item. This may be similar to how you\u2019ve booked campaigns for mobile or the web.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Google will then ensure your ads can reach those consuming content on smart TVs, OTT and other connected TV devices.<\/p>\n<h2>Measuring the results of connected TV advertising using Google Promotions<\/h2>\n<p>Of course, investing in any emerging digital marketing channel carries with it concerns of whether you\u2019ll achieve your desired goals. If you\u2019re counting on<a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/black-friday-product-advertisers-how-to-create-google-merchant-promotions\/\"> a Google ads promotion to drive sales amid the holidays<\/a>, for example, you probably can\u2019t afford to make a wrong choice.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately,<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/displayvideo\/answer\/13603725?hl=en\"> Google has continued to introduce new capabilities<\/a> that help ensure alignment between your eCommerce goals and your campaign effectiveness. These include:<\/p>\n<h3>Optimized targeting<\/h3>\n<p>Using its own artificial intelligence (AI) applications, Google has said it can help brands not only reach their desired audiences but help them find consumers most likely to respond to CTV ads. This can help strike a balance between precision advertising and not overstepping on consumer privacy or turning to third-party cookies.<\/p>\n<h3>Identity reconciliation<\/h3>\n<p>Consumers don\u2019t like feeling as though they\u2019re being pursued relentlessly around the web by a brand. Google said it will help avoid this by distinguishing between those who have visited a brand\u2019s site vs. that of a publisher. This will turn connected TV advertising into a more focused channel, where <b>consumers are served a campaign when it\u2019s most relevan<\/b>t.<\/p>\n<h3>Reach Planner<\/h3>\n<p>Is YouTube your best option for CTV ads? What about Roku, Hulu or one of many other streaming services? Google\u2019s toll allows you to evaluate these publishers based on incremental as well as <b>unique reach<\/b>. This can build greater confidence in the connected TV advertising decisions you make with Google Promotions.<\/p>\n<h3>Unique Reach Overlap<\/h3>\n<p>Managing ad frequency is important because it\u2019s easy to unnecessarily duplicate efforts over multiple CTV devices. By offering a greater understanding on where they\u2019re driving the greatest performance with their Google Promotions with connected TV ads, Google is letting you <b>maximize return on investment<\/b> (ROI).<\/p>\n<h2>How does connected TV advertising open up opportunities for localized Google Promotions?<\/h2>\n<p>Traditionally, brands have advertised on linear TV by purchasing a spot from a network operator. These spots were then converted into a CPM based on the number of households reached.<\/p>\n<p>CTV ads tend to be purchased a little differently. Brands often buy inventory directly from the publisher, or programmatically using a demand side provider (DMP).<\/p>\n<p>Using Google can offer a more streamlined approach given that many brands are already seeding Google Promotions with ads to run across multiple channels. Google also offers what it calls Deal ID forecasting, which helps advertisers understand how a Preferred Deal or Programmatic Guaranteed deal might perform before it runs.<\/p>\n<p>With a service called <b>Instant Reserve<\/b>, meanwhile, Google lets you book premium placements on its <b>YouTube connected TV advertising inventory.<\/b> This includes YouTube TV and YouTube Select.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of how you book, CTV advertising opens up opportunities to<b> target audiences based on demographics and interests<\/b>, such as high-income households who are predisposed to fashion and lifestyle content. Connected TV ads also support geotargeting, which allows you narrow campaigns even further to designated neighbourhoods or other areas.<\/p>\n<p>That means consumers watching a fashion show being streamed through a CTV service could also be served local Google Promotions that identify clothing and accessories they could buy at a nearby store. The same tactic could work for eCommerce brands that prioritize fast shipping close to their manufacturing sites.<\/p>\n<p>In this way,<b> pairing Google Promotions and Connected TV advertising<\/b> could complement the work you\u2019re already doing by running <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/local-inventory-ads\/\">local inventory ads (LIAs)<\/a> when consumers are searching on the web.<\/p>\n<h2>Why successful CTV ads and Google Promotions rely on optimized product feeds<\/h2>\n<p>Remember that connected TV advertising tends to focus on the end result: what appears on the screen. To ensure consumers see relevant Google Promotions, you must avoid any errors in <strong>how product data feeds from your catalog.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An automated solution supports this by mapping the relevant promotional ID to products within Google Merchant Center that will appeal to the target audience on CTV. This improves campaign planning and goal-setting. Using a platform that allows <strong>frequent updates to reflect changes in inventory levels<\/strong> will ensure that CTV ads only showcase Google Promotions for available products, providing peace of mind.<\/p>\n<p>Consider utilizing a <strong>product feed management solution<\/strong> as you conduct pilot projects <strong>using CTV ads for localized Google ads promotions<\/strong> during peak buying periods like the holidays. Then, based on the results, you can be prepared to scale further as streaming audiences continue to grow<\/p>\n<p><i>For a close-up look at how Suvae.org can get your product data feeds in a position to make use of connected TV advertising, <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/book-a-demo\/\"><i>get in touch and see a demo<\/i><\/a><i> today.<br \/>\n<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Related Articles<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/new-omnichannel-shopping-experience-retailers\/\" rel=\"noopener\">The New Omnichannel Experience Retailers Must Master<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/local-inventory-ads-2023\/\" rel=\"noopener\">Why Google Shopping Local Inventory Ads are a Must-Do For Marketers<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/google-merchant-center-feed-optimization\/\" rel=\"noopener\">Essential Feed Optimization Techniques for Google Merchant Center<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Savvy shoppers are always keeping an eye out for their next purchase, whether it\u2019s scrolling through social media or visiting their favorite online marketplaces.
