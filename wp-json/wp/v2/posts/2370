By building their proprietary online marketplace, brands can create their stores, synchronize products with their eCommerce catalog and pay a commission to the magazine or newspaper publisher.<br \/>\nRead all about it in the following post.<\/p>\n<h2>How did newspaper and magazine publishers go from selling ads to also selling products?<\/h2>\n<p>Andrew Rolf, previously head of Commercial Delivery at The Guardian, answers this question in an interview with <a href=\"http:\/\/Suvae.org\">Suvae.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Savvy magazine publishers have always looked to build a revenue model that blends different streams; newsstand sales, advertising, and subscriptions typically form the bulk of revenues. But magazine publishers have another way of generating income from the readers they have worked hard to establish. Selling products. And why not? Loyal audiences often see the magazine that serves their passion as the place for inspiration; it&#8217;s not a huge leap to satisfy that inspiration by offering an inventory of products. In the digital world, that inventory can be a click away.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Can you give me a brief overview of how newspapers and magazines went from selling print ads to products online?<\/h2>\n<p>Inspired by the <a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article\/special-report-the-advertising-century\/ad-age-advertising-century-timeline\/143661\/\">Ad Age Advertising Century Timeline<\/a>\u00a0infographic and <a href=\"https:\/\/wiland.com\/market\/publishing\/today-tomorrow\">A Brief History and Outlook of Magazine and Newspaper Publishing<\/a> article you can see how long it took print advertising to evolve and in less than 20 years, how everything changed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1742<\/strong><br \/>\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article\/special-report-the-advertising-century\/ad-age-advertising-century-timeline\/143661\/\">first magazine advertisement <\/a>was published in 1742 in Benjamin Franklin\u2019s general magazine. The strategy was to sell subscriptions to big audiences and advertisers will spend large sums of money to reach your circulation. It was a profitable model that lasted for over 250 years.<\/p>\n<p><b>1906<\/b><br \/>\nW.K. Kellogg Kellogg<a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/directory\/kellogg-co\/251\">Kellogg places his first ads for Corn Flakes <\/a>in six midwestern newspapers.

Advertising platforms like digital video commercials, ad banners\/display ads, sponsorships, and rich media reached nearly $10 billion.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><em><br \/>\n<\/em>In 2017 can online magazine and newspaper publishers compete with search engine and social media advertising? Where does eCommerce fit in?<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s not a matter of competing with Search Engine Marketing and Social Media Marketing for sponsors\u2019 dollars. Magazine and Newspaper Publishers need to complement those digital channels and find their niche in the online marketing ecosystem.<br \/>\nAdvertising options are quickly evolving to more innovative content formats like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>in-article video<\/li>\n<li>video pre-roll<\/li>\n<li>educational articles<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/marketing\/nytvr\/\">virtual reality content<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Facebook Live<\/li>\n<li>mini branded documentaries like <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.theguardian.com\/where-i-went-right\/\">The Guardian\u2019s Where I Went Right Responsive Video Series<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><em><br \/>\n<\/em>Even with all of these engaging advertising formats and their potential revenue opportunity, publishers in 2016 are still worried about how to replace lost print sales.<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The editors at AdAge comment on how the<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article\/media\/york-times-acquires-wirecutter-sister-site\/306434\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times has included eCommerce as part of their revenue model<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;T<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he New York Times, like most newspaper companies, hit hard by industry-wide declines in print advertising revenue, is looking to generate more digital consumer and advertising revenue.\u201d explained the editors from The Ad Age. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Thompson, in the release, said the Times is trying to become &#8220;an authoritative destination for service journalism.&#8221; In addition to a Cooking product, the company also has verticals dedicated to entertainment recommendations (Watching) and wellness (Well).

Which options are they exploring?<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Online Store<\/strong><br \/>\nIn comparison to an online marketplace, an online store can sell products from one or multiple vendors but they control payment logistics, order fulfillment, and customer service. They are accountable for inventory and everything to do with the website and customer experience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Online Marketplace<\/strong><br \/>\nAn online marketplace is a multi-vendor online store that offers numerous items from multiple vendors. Vendors can list their products in a marketplace, but they need to be accountable for everything from their product listings to payment logistics, order fulfillment, and customer service. The most popular examples include <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\">Amazon<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/ebay.com\">eBay<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"http:\/\/etsy.com\">Etsy<\/a>. Online marketplaces have fewer upfront costs. With that comes less control over post-sale logistics like customer service, shipping, and delivery.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Affiliate Model<\/strong><br \/>\nAdvertisers can use an affiliate marketing network to advertise specific products on websites with related content. Affiliate websites could include Mommy Blogs with advertisements for baby products or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.elle.com\/\">Elle Magazine<\/a> featuring fashion items from advertisers.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><em><br \/>\n<\/em>Which magazine and newspaper sites have adopted an eCommerce strategy?<\/h2>\n<p>In the publishing world, niche magazine websites with loyal audiences see the most success with eCommerce.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/store.latimes.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LA Times<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Online Shop)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/shop.nationalgeographic.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Geographic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Online Shop)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.elle.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elle Magazine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Affiliate Model)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.golfsmith.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Golf Magazine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Online Shop)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/shop.menshealth.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Men\u2019s Health<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Online Shop)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Wirecutter<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Affiliate Model)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.countrylife.co.uk\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Country Life Magazine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Online Marketplace)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/carbuyer.co.uk\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carbuyer Magazine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online Marketplace<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/femail\/fashionfinder\/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daily Mail Femail Fashion Finder<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Affiliate Model)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/style.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Style.com by Cond<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00e9 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nast<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Online Shop in Europe only)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><em><br \/>\n<\/em>What is the best approach with matters to eCommerce strategy?<\/h2>\n<p>In the case of magazine and newspaper publishers, there is no perfect choice to enter the world of selling products online.
