This post provides a quick explanation of affiliate marketing, a list of affiliate networks operating in Europe, and when you should consider a product feed for affiliate network partners.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Affiliate Marketing?<\/h2>\n<p>Affiliate marketing involves paying a commission to affiliates on sales made to customers that have been directed to your site from the affiliate\u2019s website. Because you only pay when a sale is made, you are guaranteed a return on your investment.<\/p>\n<p>For those of you who are new to affiliate marketing, this <b>video<\/b> from Neil Patel explains the basics.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"What is Affiliate Marketing And How Can You Leverage It\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/4ZrSmfo16sk?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https:\/\/Suvae.org\"  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>How to choose an Affiliate Network<\/h2>\n<p>Affiliate networks provide the infrastructure for affiliates (or publishers) to get in contact with advertisers (online merchants). These networks also provide tracking technology that tells advertisers which publishers made the sale so they can be duly rewarded. Many networks even offer services to help advertisers manage their affiliate programs.<\/p>\n<p>Choosing the right network can be a difficult decision. Many factors like which industries they focus on, the affiliates included in their network and who their audiences are, the commission, how and when you get paid as a seller, and how easy it is as an advertiser to promote your products. In many cases, you need to check out reviews, talk to other businesses that have used the affiliate network, or test the network out for yourself.<\/p>\n<h2>European Affiliate Networks<\/h2>\n<p>Europe is a fragmented market with numerous languages and currencies. Some networks focus on only a few countries whereas others have a broader reach. It\u2019s important to know if the affiliate network you choose has a comprehensive knowledge of the markets you want to target to better attract your ideal customers.<\/p>\n<p>Check out the list below and find the affiliate networks that best suit your business.<\/p>\n<h5><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/rakutenadvertising.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rakuten Advertising<\/a><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><b>Reach: <\/b>Europe and around the globe<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy Rakuten\u2019s massive reach of over 150,000 active publishers worldwide, with a dedicated team of network development specialists who actively identify affiliates and partner opportunities across content, influencer, loyalty, and more.
