This represents more than a third of total retail eCommerce sales. That trend is expected to continue over the next five years when the rate of U.S. marketplace growth will surpass 12%.<\/p>\n<p>Expanding sales into online marketplaces in the USA can help you reach a broader audience, increase product visibility, and significantly improve your sales.<\/p>\n<p>While many brands are already familiar with the biggest USA marketplace players, it pays to do your research. Depending on how you set up your products and promote them, there\u2019s a whole world of untapped potential to reach consumers who might never have discovered your brand otherwise.<\/p>\n<h2>Online Marketplaces in the USA: The Top Choices<\/h2>\n<p>The growth of online marketplaces in the USA continues unabated, accompanied by increasing competition. The oversaturation of retailers within these marketplaces presents formidable barriers to overcome.<br \/>\nThat&#8217;s why many retailers and distributors have taken matters into their own hands by establishing their own USA marketplaces. This initiative has enabled them to reduce shipping costs, streamline product assortment processes, and strengthen supplier relationships.<\/p>\n<p>One major benefit of this strategy is the consolidation of multiple product options, providing customers with a <strong>single eCommerce destination and a simpler, unified shopping experience.<\/strong><br \/>\nLet&#8217;s delve into some of the top online marketplace options in the US where you can start selling your products, and explore how a marketplace integrator can streamline the integration process.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Amazon<\/b><\/h3>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16152 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/amazon-screen.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon marketplace\" width=\"750\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/amazon-screen.jpg 750w, https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/amazon-screen-480x241.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw\" \/><b><\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Amazon Marketplace U.S. is not only the most recognized U.S. marketplace but boasts <a href=\"https:\/\/amzscout.net\/blog\/amazon-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some of the industry\u2019s biggest numbers<\/a>. These include 310 million active users (80% of whom are based in the U.S.), an estimated two billion web visitors a month, and more than 600 million products.<\/p>\n<p>On the flip side, there are also more than two million sellers already using Amazon as an eCommerce channel, and about 1.1 million of them are specifically using the company\u2019s online marketplace in the USA.<\/p>\n<p>Selling on Amazon generally happens in several ways. Traditionally, sellers could opt for the <b>Vendor Central<\/b> or wholesale approach, where products are sold in bulk to Amazon. While this is a straightforward way to get your products listed, it means you\u2019re losing any control over the final price of customer lists.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Fulfillment by Merchant (FBM)<\/b> means you\u2019ll handle logistics and delivery yourself. You\u2019ll either need to have strong in-house logistics capabilities or another partner that can meet the requirements of Amazon\u2019s service levels. These include selling products on time, an order cancellation rate of less than .5%, and adherence to Amazon\u2019s return policy. FBM means fewer Amazon fees and more control over your inventory, but also greater responsibility and focus on getting products to customers rather than marketing and selling to them.<\/li>\n<li><b>Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA)<\/b>, on the other hand, means the company will not only list your products in its USA marketplace but handle storing, picking, packing, and shipping your products. Choosing FBA means you benefit from Amazon Prime shipping rates, can have products featured on the Buy Box where customers see \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d or \u201cBuy Now\u201d and Amazon\u2019s customer service capabilities. The downside? There are fees associated with this, of course, so calculate your return on investment (ROI) for both options before deciding.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Amazon sells many of the products in its marketplace itself, of course, which means you have to approach it strategically.<\/p>\n<p><b>Some best practices include:\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enroll in the<a href=\"https:\/\/brandservices.amazon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Amazon brand registry<\/a>, which offers tools to protect your intellectual property and improve your customer experience<\/li>\n<li>Once you\u2019ve enrolled in the registry, explore tools such as Amazon A+ Content (previously known as Enhanced Brand Content or EBC), which allows you to include additional product information and images to your listing and make them more compelling for eCommerce shoppers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Best-Sellers\/zgbs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monitor Amazon best sellers<\/a> to see which products might be trending and whether or not that will affect your eCommerce strategy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>eBay<\/b><\/h3>\n<h2><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16157 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/ebay-screen.jpg\" alt=\"ebay marketplace\" width=\"750\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/ebay-screen.jpg 750w, https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/ebay-screen-480x241.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw\" \/><\/h2>\n<p>With 133 million active users, eBay is another of the online marketplace USA giants. It\u2019s also a good example of how online shopping behavior is shifting from desktops to smartphones. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/smallbiztrends.com\/2023\/06\/ebay-statistics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">58% of sales on eBay\u2019s U.S. marketplace happen on mobile devices<\/a>. The company also boasts 18 million sellers, which range from everyday consumers getting rid of junk in their attics to sizable retail brands.<\/p>\n<p>Selling on eBay\u2019s U.S. marketplace means bearing in mind the various fees that are associated with the process. This includes insertion fees for listing products, \u201cfinal value\u201d fees once a product sells, and optional fees to upgrade listings such as bold fonts, subtitles, and a minimum\/reserve price.<\/p>\n<p>To sell on eBay, you\u2019ll have to adopt its proprietary <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebay.com\/sellercenter\/payments-and-fees\/payments-and-earnings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">managed payments system<\/a>, where revenue payouts can be scheduled or made on demand.<\/p>\n<p>Like all major USA marketplaces, eBay continually tries to improve the seller experience. Some of the most recent updates include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebay.ca\/sellercentre\/resources\/seller-updates\/2023-summer\/business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tools to resolve payment disputes and block inappropriate messages<\/a>, for example, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebay.ca\/sellercentre\/resources\/seller-updates\/2023-summer\/listing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dynamic ad rates for promoted listings and ad rate forecasts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.ebay.com\/api-docs\/sell\/static\/inventory\/matching-products.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Integrating <\/a>with eBay\u2019s USA online marketplace can work as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have your developers choose <b>eBay\u2019s Inventory API or Trading API<\/b> to create or revise a product listing and match your product to those in the eBay catalog<\/li>\n<li>Include whatever product details are necessary based on the eBay product category.

This could be because 85% of Walmart customers make at least one online purchase a month, according to the company.<\/p>\n<p>Walmart tries to help brands on its online USA marketplace stand out through Sponsored Search Ads, and like Amazon, it offers fulfillment services to handle many of the common post-purchase chores.<\/p>\n<p>Since it works on a commission basis, <a href=\"https:\/\/marketplace.walmart.com\/about-walmart-marketplace\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Walmart Marketplace<\/a> doesn\u2019t charge initial setup or monthly\/annual fees. It also offers what it describes as lucrative referral fees. The bar for getting on board as a seller is higher, however. Its criteria include a demonstrated \u201chistory of the marketplace of eCommerce success,\u201d a catalog that complies with its prohibited products policy, and proof you\u2019re working with a B2C warehouse if you don\u2019t use Walmart\u2019s fulfillment services.<\/p>\n<p>Integrating with Walmart Marketplace can take a few forms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <b>a third-party online marketplace USA solution provider<\/b>, a selection of which Walmart has curated on its marketplace site<\/li>\n<li>Manually <b>search for Walmart\u2019s Item Management APIs<\/b> and have your internal developers test with the provided XML Schema Definition in Walmart\u2019s API sandbox<br \/>\n.<\/li>\n<li>Set up a profile on Walmart\u2019s online Seller Center and try using <b>Setup By Match, Single Item, or Bulk Upload Setup<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Target Plus\u2122<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16155 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/target-plus-screen.jpg\" alt=\"Target plus marketplace\" width=\"750\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/target-plus-screen.jpg 750w, https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/target-plus-screen-480x241.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/plus.target.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Target Plus\u2122<\/b><\/a> operates as an invite-only marketplace, making it an exclusive space for carefully vetted brands and retailers.
