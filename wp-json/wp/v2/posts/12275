This isn\u2019t limited to a single third-party store such as Amazon, either. The research showed that <strong>42% of retailers sell through four or more marketplaces.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12280 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Why-online-marketplaces-are-a-growth-driver.jpg\" alt=\"Why-online-marketplaces-are-a-growth-driver\" width=\"700\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Why-online-marketplaces-are-a-growth-driver.jpg 700w, https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Why-online-marketplaces-are-a-growth-driver-480x322.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 700px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The traditional drawback of listing products on sites such as Mango, Lamoda, Zalando, and others has been the cost and effort <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/onboard-multiple-online-marketplaces-effectively\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">onboarding<\/a> required.<br \/>\nSome of the potential bottlenecks have included:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Difficulty managing inventory and orders across multiple marketplaces at once<\/li>\n<li>Managing customer relationships across more than one third-party store<\/li>\n<li>Lack of consistent branding and messaging from one store to another<\/li>\n<li>Difficulty controlling pricing, logistics, and custom interactions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What is eCommerce Marketplace Integration?<\/h2>\n<p>The rise of eCommerce marketplace integration services is providing online retailers a way to transcend these issues by unifying data from multiple sources.<\/p>\n<p>By using an application programming interface (API) for example, marketplace integration tools can act as a two-way link that connects a single selling platform to many different third-party stores at once.<br \/>\nThis includes connecting to inventory, mapping product uploads to their proper category, transferring data, syncing across channels, and fulfilling orders in real-time.<\/p>\n<p>Once eCommerce marketplace integration has been deployed, you can syndicate your product listings and catalogs to multiple online marketplaces.<br \/>\nAlso, you can more easily<strong> track and manage orders, keep stock of inventory, and spend more time focusing on nurturing customer relationships.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>How eCommerce Marketplace Integration Services Work<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12282\" src=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/How-marketplace-integration-services-work.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Your goal with marketplace integration should be to reach a point of \u201cagnostic eCommerce.\u201d In other words, you want to be focused on simply driving sales, without having to worry about which marketplace your orders are coming from.<\/p>\n<p>Achieving this without putting undue burdens on developers means working with an expert eCommerce marketplace service partner that can identify the best approach.<\/p>\n<p>These can vary depending on the retailer but include:<\/p>\n<h3>Complete and thorough object specifications<\/h3>\n<p>While customer activity might look different from one third-party store to another, there might be common use cases in terms of what\u2019s required to support taxation, returns, refunds, and partial orders.<br \/>\nChoose the order schemas that apply to the majority of your orders to<strong> simplify the integration process.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Extensible object specifications<\/h3>\n<p>Even in a well-run eCommerce operation, anomalies or exceptions to the rule will occasionally come up.<br \/>\nTalk to your marketplace integration provider about how they can <strong>handle custom properties<\/strong>, such as pairs of names and values, or other unforeseen<strong> data requirements.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Acceptable actions<b><i><\/i><\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The more you can automate eCommerce processes, the more streamlined your company is and the greater the potential for increased sales.<br \/>\nBy specifying a list of what actions the integration tool can take depending on the API response and payloads, you\u2019ll have <strong>greater confidence in the status of your orders.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Configurable process sequences<\/h3>\n<p>Talk to your partner about the way you\u2019ll handle pre-accepted orders, or when orders are postponed after an inventory check.<br \/>\nDoing so will offer <strong>greater consistency in the customer experience you deliver,<\/strong> no matter what marketplace they\u2019re using to shop for your products.<\/p>\n<h3>Escape routes<\/h3>\n<p>What if none of the above tactics work? The best market integration service providers know that sometimes it\u2019s necessary to leverage specific fields in the order schema.<br \/>\nThis is a way of programmatically determining which marketplace is being used and <strong>allowing orders to be processed smoothly.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Master the art of eCommerce Order Management across third-party stores<\/h2>\n<p>Suvae.org has a proven track record of helping leading fashion and luxury brands propel their online sales by expanding into <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/top-online-marketplace-sites-for-ecommerce-merchants-to-sell-at-scale\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the world\u2019s most popular online marketplaces<\/a>.
