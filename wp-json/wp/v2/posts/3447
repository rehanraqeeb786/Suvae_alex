So, if you are wondering how to increase the visibility of your products and better target the right customers on Facebook, look no further.<br \/>\nIn this post, you&#8217;ll learn all you need to know about Facebook Remarketing, and how Facebook Dynamic Product Ads can help improve your remarketing strategy efforts.<\/p>\n<h2>What are Facebook Dynamic Product Ads (DPA)?<\/h2>\n<p>Dynamic Product Ads make it easy for merchants to get ads for relevant products in front of interested customers on Facebook. They let you scale the delivery of relevant ads to Facebook users by combining a product feed with an ad template that needs to be created just once.\u00a0 Facebook automatically draws data from your product feed and populates the template with relevant products.\u00a0 The choice of products that the viewer sees is based on the Facebook user&#8217;s past behavior on your website or app.\u00a0 You are also able to reach new potential customers through the creation of lookalike audiences.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">What do Dynamic Product Ads look like?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-13223 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/fb-Dynamic-Product-Ads-1.jpg\" alt=\"facebook dynamic ads\" width=\"820\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/fb-Dynamic-Product-Ads-1.jpg 820w, https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/fb-Dynamic-Product-Ads-1-480x270.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 820px, 100vw\" \/><br \/>\nDPA&#8217;s are versatile and you can configure your ads to contain anywhere from 1 to 5 products. \u00a0Have a look at the examples below.<\/p>\n<p><em>Single product ad: <\/em>image_url=&#8221;1768&#8243;<\/p>\n<p><em>Multi-product ad: <\/em>image_url=&#8221;1770&#8243;<\/p>\n<p>The ads can appear within the news feed as well as in the column on the right of the news feed.\u00a0 When you set up the advertisement in Power Editor, you get to choose where your ad is shown.\u00a0 You can even choose whether you want your ads to appear on mobile or desktop or both. (<em>You can choose exactly where your ads can appear.)<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>How do Dynamic Product Ads work?<\/h2>\n<p>Essentially, Facebook Dynamic Product Ads use three elements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a product catalog updated constantly using a product data feed,<\/li>\n<li>a tracking pixel that tracks the behavior of target customers<\/li>\n<li>and a dynamic ad template.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The pixel tracks the behavior of customers such as product viewed, product added to cart, or product purchased.\u00a0 Based on that behavior, Facebook selects product data from your catalog and populates the ad template before delivering the ad to the customer.\u00a0 In this way, you can automatically show a product to someone that has viewed it on your website or added it to their basket but did not purchase it.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, if someone has purchased on your website, you can show that person a set of products that are complementary to the product they bought. As well as displaying ads to people that have already interacted with you on your website you can also use Facebook&#8217;s similar audience function to target advertisements to new customers that have similar interests to your existing customers.<\/p>\n<h2>How do you set up DPA\u2019s?<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Set up Facebook Business Manager if you haven\u2019t already done so.<\/li>\n<li>Create a product catalog in Business Manager by following <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/HSfbP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">these instructions<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Set up a product feed to continually update your product catalog\u00a0with fresh product data. \u00a0If you are a Highstreet.io client, this part couldn&#8217;t be easier. \u00a0Just tell us you want to start using DPA&#8217;s and we&#8217;ll set up the feed for you.<\/li>\n<li>Set up a Facebook Pixel to track events on your website. \u00a0Facebook has recently simplified things for advertisers with the introduction of the Facebook Pixel. This pixel combines the functions of their Custom Audience Pixel with those of their Conversion Tracking Pixel so advertisers need only to install a single pixel (more information on this can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/1686199411616919\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li>Create your dynamic product template (for instructions click\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/1577598505812743\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Next Steps<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook Dynamic Product Ads provide an effective way to target interested customers with relevant ads.\u00a0 Stay ahead of your competitors by enhancing your Facebook Dynamic Product Ads and driving more customers to your e-commerce website.<a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/contact-us\/\"><b> Contact us for more information.<\/b><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Results from a pilot program implemented by Criteo found that sales attributed to Dynamic Product Ads contributed to 6.5% of total sales.\u00a0 Apparel retailer St. Frock also saw some great results, increasing their return on ad spend (ROAS) by 480% and reducing cost per acquisition (CPA) by 70% through the use of Facebook DPA\u2019s.
