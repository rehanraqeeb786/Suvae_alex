Remember when \u201cActivewear\u201d became the new \u201cOfficewear\u201d in 2020? A new online work environment emerged consisting of cozy sweatpants on the bottom and a Zoom call-appropriate shirt on top. Today that dress code and the need for office-related items is evolving fast as more companies mandate their staff back to the office.<\/p>\n<p>As the New York Times reported,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/04\/29\/business\/casual-workwear-clothes-office.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong> Nordstrom <\/strong><strong>saw a 152 percent increase in searches on its website for the term \u201cworkwear\u201d<\/strong><\/a> in February 2022.

After two years of on and off lockdowns, employees returning to the office are searching for back-to-work clothing, and it\u2019s expected that as more businesses bring back staff, the searches for office-related clothing and products will increase.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GoogleTrends\/status\/1502032946445783051\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Trends<\/a> reported that \u201cbusiness casual outfits\u201d and \u201ccasual work outfits\u201d searches hit an all-time high in the US back in March of 2022.

This is why having a solution to adapt to your customer&#8217;s shifting lifestyle is so important.<\/p>\n<p>A popular method for keeping your inventory responsive to these market changes is Product Catalog Optimization. It\u2019s the technical process of <strong>optimizing the product data in your catalog to help online shoppers find your products<\/strong>, make an informed buying decision, and provide a better shopping experience with your brand.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12893\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/woman-shopping-online.jpg\" alt=\"product catalog optimization attracts customers\" width=\"750\" height=\"475\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/woman-shopping-online.jpg 750w, https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/woman-shopping-online-480x304.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Think of how a supermarket continually merchandises its stock based on consumer demand, seasonal items, and promotions.
