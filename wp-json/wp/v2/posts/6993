This information along with your hours of operation and contact information must be up-to-date.<br \/>\nNow is the time to <strong>prioritize frequent updates to all of your Google My Business listings to give shoppers the information they need to make a purchase.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>How Customers Find Your Google Business Listings<\/h2>\n<p>Google My Business (GMB) helps you <strong>reach customers by creating and managing information cards that appear when users enter &#8216;keywords&#8217; related to your business.<\/strong><br \/>\nThis allows them to easily find you and get in touch with you.<\/p>\n<p>All of your business details such as an address, telephone numbers, opening hours, and links to your website must be up-to-date, correct, and complete. Providing potential customers with relevant and accurate information about your business is an excellent opportunity to give them a reason to do business with you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other updates to consider:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Your business description (named \u201cFrom the business\u201d in GMB)<br \/>\n&#8211; Photos (regularly uploading geotagged photos)<br \/>\n&#8211; Ongoing posts and videos (content that will disappear after a certain time)<\/p>\n<p>Google My Business also plays a role in local SEO strategy.
