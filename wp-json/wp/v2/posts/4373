Based on your ultimate goal, Snapchat ad products can help streamline the customer journey from awareness to purchase.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the formats and dynamic product ads Snapchat offers include:<\/p>\n<h3>Snap Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Snap Ads provide brands with a powerful way to engage with Snapchat&#8217;s young and active user base, driving brand awareness, app installs, website visits, and other marketing objectives. By utilizing the platform&#8217;s creative capabilities and targeting options effectively, advertisers can deliver compelling, relevant ads that resonate with Snapchat&#8217;s audience, making Snap Ads an essential component of many brands&#8217; social media advertising strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Snap Ads are vertical, full-screen video ads that appear between user-generated Stories or within the Discover section of the app. They are typically non-skippable and can be up to 3 minutes long. Snap Ads include a &#8220;Swipe Up&#8221; call-to-action that allows users to visit a website, install an app, or view additional content.<\/p>\n<h3>Sponsored Lenses<\/h3>\n<p>Sponsored Lenses are augmented reality (AR) filters that brands can leverage to create branded AR experiences that incorporate their products, logos, or messaging into the interactive filters, to promote their products or enhance user engagement.<\/p>\n<p>Sponsored Lenses are highly interactive and shareable, making them an effective way to connect with Snapchat&#8217;s massive user base. Use this format to make a big impression on a big scale.<\/p>\n<h3>Collection Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Collection Ads allow advertisers to showcase a series of products in a single ad unit. When users tap on the ad, they are presented with a catalog of products they can browse and interact with.<\/p>\n<p>This type of ad is particularly useful for e-commerce brands<b> looking to promote multiple products in one ad. <\/b>Use this format to <b>\u00a0<\/b>giving Snapchatters a frictionless way to browse and buy, while creating a smooth shopping experience that helps you bring in more buyers.<\/p>\n<h3>Story Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Reach people with a series of up to 20 Single Image or Video Ads. You can use this format to connect with consumers in between the Stories they see or through a branded tile appearing in Snapchat\u2019s Discover section.<\/p>\n<p>Use these full-screen ads to provide an immersive and engaging experience for users.<\/p>\n<h3>Dynamic Product Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Snapchat Dynamic Product Ads enable advertisers to automatically promote relevant products to individual users based on their browsing behavior and interests. These ads are highly personalized and tailored to the user&#8217;s preferences.<\/p>\n<p>Dynamic product ads help reach users in two distinct ways:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n<li>Show Snapchatters ads, built directly from your product catalog, that are tailored to them based on their actions taken on your site or in your app.<\/li>\n<li>Cast a wider net on Snapchat and find prospective customers by serving them relevant products built directly from your product catalog.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/forbusiness.snapchat.com\/advertising\/ad-formats?_sid=PAID&amp;utm_campaign=ca_en_pmax_broad_broad&amp;utm_content=whysnapchatads&amp;utm_medium=paidb2b&amp;utm_source=pmax&amp;utm_term=dynamic_valueprop1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwoK2mBhDzARIsADGbjerS7v1PCA58gCs7wtY-Hbk7GX-anyUsQ6QyT9Keqlm0q0rbqR-3sHIaAon9EALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Find more on Snapchat Ads Format\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Snapchat ad content restrictions: What you need to know<\/h2>\n<p>Although the geographical targets for using a Snapchat Product Data Feed have expanded worldwide, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.snap.com\/en-US\/ad-policies\/#restricted-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>content within Snapchat ads is subject to certain geographical restrictions<\/b><\/a> depending on the country you want to target.<br \/>\n<b>Note: <\/b><b>These content restrictions do not affect Clothing &amp; Apparel product ads.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2>Creating a Snapchat Product Feed: The fundamentals<\/h2>\n<p>To leverage Snapchat ad products and better promote your products to its audience, you need to first decide:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n<li>How you want to structure your Snapchat Product Feed<\/li>\n<li>How to Upload your library of products, either manually or automatically<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><b>Manually<\/b>, which means you enter your product information into a spreadsheet according to Snapchat\u2019s specifications.<\/p>\n<p><b>Automatically<\/b>, which means using an extension, plugin, app, or service that pulls data from your site and formats it for you.
