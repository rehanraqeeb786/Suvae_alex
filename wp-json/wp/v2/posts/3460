With statistics like these, it\u2019s worth making use of every attribute of your shopping feed, including the category field, to get the best results out of your ads.<\/p>\n<p>Learn all about how to better structure your campaigns for maximum discoverability by reading the following post.<\/p>\n<p>But first, let\u2019s take a closer look at what Google Shopping Product Categories are, and why you should spend more time optimizing your product\u2019s information.<\/p>\n<h2>What is a Google Product Category?<\/h2>\n<p>A Google Product Category helps you categorize an item into a specific set of products, which leads to having people easily find your products. It also helps Google to identify the correct category in your shopping feed, to which your products belong to.<\/p>\n<p>The information in your Google Shopping Product Category attribute within your feed is critical to the performance of your Shopping campaigns. Although [google_product_category] is an optional field, if you leave it blank, the data will be automatically populated based on other factors like your GTIN and\/or product title.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s like leaving the address field blank when you purchase a product online, and you use the autofill function without double-checking that they added your most recent information.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s always best to check that the information is correct, or you could have problems. This is why you need to submit a complete product data feed using the most appropriate category for each of your items to the Merchant Center. Otherwise, you leave the decision up to Google\u2019s algorithm.<\/p>\n<h2>How Google Product Categories Work<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13540\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Product-Category.jpg\" alt=\"Google Product Categories Optimization\" width=\"750\" height=\"629\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Product-Category.jpg 750w, https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Product-Category-480x402.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 750px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Google Product Categories Optimization<\/p>\n<p>Like optimizing other fields in your feed, such as title, color, and description, you want to choose the best option from Google\u2019s taxonomy that provides your customers with the best results.<\/p>\n<p>The product category field serves a dual purpose.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It helps the platform to match your products with search queries for specific types of items.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The result is an increase in clicks from relevant customer searches.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if someone looks for a particular dress and your category only includes \u201cClothing &amp; Accessories\u201d instead of \u201cClothing &amp; Accessories &gt; Clothing &gt; Dresses\u201d\u00a0 , your ad may not show up for that search which means fewer relevant clicks for that Ad Group.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Your products get better exposure on other shopping channels, like Facebook, that use the same taxonomy. The outcome is a better result from your omnichannel marketing.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When you run a shopping campaign on another platform, like Facebook, you can use the category attribute to segment your ads. This approach allows for different items you sell to be displayed in a single ad unit based on category.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you understand the fundamentals of what Google Merchant Center Product CategoriesGoogle Product Categories are and how they work, let\u2019s take a look at the next part of the process: the implementation.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Are Google Product Categories so Important?<\/h2>\n<p>Google Product Categories provide an important signal to the platform about how relevant your products are to a category compared to other advertisers\u2019 products. The more applicable your category is to the product you\u2019re advertising, the better your ads will perform. It\u2019s that simple.<\/p>\n<p>Other benefits include:<\/p>\n<p>The correct tax rate is applied to your products because of the category it\u2019s in<\/p>\n<p>The correct advertising policy is applied to your products based on the category<\/p>\n<p>Increased performance based on the relevancy of your ad to the search query<\/p>\n<p>To explain these concepts further, here are two analogies everyone can relate to.<\/p>\n<p>Scenario 1: No Category<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re in a hurry, and you need to pick up a golf shirt to wear at a game later that day. You go to a sporting goods store that you know sells golf shirts. When you walk in, you start looking for the clothing section, but instead of sections, everything is everywhere. You scan the store and see golf clubs, shoes, accessories, balls, and clothing mixed together. Where do you start looking for a shirt? How do you find it quickly and then pay to get to your game on time?<\/p>\n<p>Scenario 2: Wrong Category<\/p>\n<p>What if the store had everything categorized logically, but the item you were looking for somehow ended up in the wrong section? The manager saw the item you were looking for was a white golf shirt, but instead of being placed in the men\u2019s section, she placed it in the women\u2019s section. Pretty frustrating from a customer perspective.<\/p>\n<p>These two situations can happen online when you leave Google to guess which category your product is most suited for. At the end of the day, its AI, just like a store employee, isn\u2019t perfect.<\/p>\n<p>This is why it\u2019s so important to place your products in the right category, Think about your customers, and allow them to easily find what they are looking for. The better experience they\u2019ll have with your products and your brand, the more likely they will pursue the purchase, and choose you instead of others.<\/p>\n<h2>Google Product Category Taxonomy<\/h2>\n<p>To choose the right product category for Google Merchant Center, follow the hierarchy most relevant to your product using <b>Google\u2019s Product Category Taxonomy.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Note: In Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States, you can use the [google_product_category] to optimize the searchability of your Shopping campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>For all other countries, use [product_type] to help with search and bidding strategies for your Google Shopping campaigns.<\/p>\n<h2>Google Product Category Examples<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some examples of how to structure your category for different types of products from <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/6324436?hl=en#zippy=%2Capparel-products%2Csoftware-subscription%2Cmobile-phones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Merchant Center\u2019s product category<\/a> best practices.<\/p>\n<h3>Apparel<\/h3>\n<p>An example of a well-chosen product category for a dress is:<\/p>\n<p>Clothing &amp; Accessories &gt; Clothing &gt; Dresses&gt;<\/p>\n<h3>Software<\/h3>\n<p>Software &gt; Computer Software &gt; Antivirus &amp; Security Software (ID: 5299)<\/p>\n<h3>Mobile Phones<\/h3>\n<p>Electronics &gt; Communications &gt; Telephony &gt; Mobile Phones<\/p>\n<h2>How to Implement a Google Product Category Taxonomy<\/h2>\n<p>To accurately implement Google Product Categories for optimal visibility on Google Shopping, there are certain terms, guidelines and processes you need to understand.<b><\/b><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Review Google Shopping\u2019s Product Category Guidelines<br \/>\n<\/b>Review their official documentation and resources to understand their product category taxonomy structure.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Understand Google Supported Values<br \/>\n<\/b>A Google-supported value for the category attribute in your data feed is simply the acceptable content they will approve.
