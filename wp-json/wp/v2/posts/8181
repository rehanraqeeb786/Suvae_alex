The difference is that thanks to Zalando marketplace, the company is building upon its success by helping other brands grow.<\/p>\n<h2>How does Zalando Work and What Types of Businesses Sell on it?<\/h2>\n<p>Zalando Marketplace is a German-based, European eCommerce platform company that provides retail services for lifestyle and fashion brands. Though it began primarily with footwear, Zalando has since expanded into a wide range of clothing, accessories, and even toys.<\/p>\n<p>Through Zalando Priiv\u00e8, meanwhile, the company offers discounts to more than 2,500 other brands. Available through a mobile app, Zalando Priiv\u00e8 is intended to complement its core online store, which focuses on the newest and freshest assortment.<\/p>\n<p>The company provides premium services for eCommerce companies interested in improving their ability to market themselves and connecting them with customers.<\/p>\n<p>A data-backed approach allows Zalando to feature your products to the right customers, improving your sales performance with ZMS (<a href=\"https:\/\/zms.zalando.com\/\"><b>Zalando Marketing Services<\/b><\/a>) growth techniques, branding, and analytical insights.<\/p>\n<p>Zalando\u2019s custom API provides eCommerce integration to online retailers interested in using the platform to sell products. Zalando Marketplace also offers assistance with onboarding, product registration and uploading, and branding.<\/p>\n<h2>Selling premium and luxury fashion on Zalando marketplace<\/h2>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16303 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/zalando-shoes.jpg\" alt=\"zalando\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/zalando-shoes.jpg 900w, https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/zalando-shoes-480x160.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 900px, 100vw\" \/><\/h3>\n<p>According to an article on <i>FashionUnited<\/i>, <a href=\"https:\/\/fashionunited.uk\/news\/fashion\/from-gen-alpha-to-high-heels-for-men-the-trends-in-the-luxury-segment-at-zalando\/2023011067205\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zalando is prioritizing adding premium and luxury brands<\/a> that its customers are searching for online. This has led to an increase of products in these categories from approximately 30,000 in 2020 to more than 90,000 in 2023. This could make Zalando marketplace integration a good idea if you want to be part of a fast-growing platform for luxury shoppers.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, however, Zalando is responding to increased pressure to stay profitable by being more selective and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildetail.eu\/news\/fashion\/zalando-reduces-product-range\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">removing some brands from the Zalando Partner Program<\/a>, which is how sellers become part of the Zalando marketplace. This means brands looking to sell on its platform moving forward may have to stand out, either by demonstrating strong online sales to date or by offering fashion and accessories that can\u2019t easily be found elsewhere.<\/p>\n<h2>The benefit of using Zalando<\/h2>\n<p>Selling on Zalando marketplace means your brand will gain a foothold in 25 countries. This includes more than 50 million active customers with an average basket size of 56.2 euros, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/topics\/7153\/zalando\/#topicOverview\">data from Statista<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While there is no Zalando U.S. yet, the company has <a href=\"https:\/\/ecommercenews.eu\/zalando-puts-launch-in-the-us-on-hold\/\">announced <\/a>a Zalando in USA expansion plan. This could bring a Zalando USA shipping option to American customers that want greater access to European brands.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, Zalando\u2019s size and scale offer brands a significant platform to increase their visibility among European customers. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/ww.fashionnetwork.com\/news\/Zalando-amazon-inditex-lead-in-european-cross-border-fashion-e-tail,1438624.html#:~:text=As%20for%20e%2Dtailers%2C%20CCE,Spanish%20group%20Inditex%20with%206.2%25.\">data from Cross-Border Europe<\/a>, for example, Zalando was ahead of Amazon in terms of cross-border eCommerce sales in Europe, boasting an 11.7% share of total sales.<\/p>\n<p>As with any decision to sell on marketplaces, of course, brands need to weigh the financial commitment and investments required. While it previously only charged sellers a commission, for example, <i>ECommerce Times<\/i> reported that <a href=\"https:\/\/ecommercenews.eu\/zalando-increases-rates-for-merchants\/\">Zalando has introduced a subscription fee<\/a> of 480 euros (or 40 euros a month) for those participating in its marketplace. Commission rates for products sold exclusively on its platform will range from 7% to 25%. When products Zalando offers directly are sold out, partners may also offer those items and will be charged a commission ranging between 5% and 22%.<\/p>\n<p>Besides its Partner Program, Zalando offers wholesale services as well as a program called Connected Retail, which links physical stores to its platform.<\/p>\n<h2>How to get started selling on Zalando marketplace<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-8196 aligncenter\" title=\"zalando louge\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Untitled-design-4.jpg\" alt=\"zalando louge \" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Like most online marketplaces, Zalando requires those applying to its Partner Program to have a registered business with an online store, products available in relevant fashion and footwear categories, as well as free delivery\/returns, and a 100-day return policy.<\/p>\n<p>The full checklist of Zalando marketplace eligibility criteria includes:<\/p>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 20px;\">\n<ul>\n<li>All products must be assigned a European Article Number<\/li>\n<li>Products must comply with Zalando labeling and packaging conditions<\/li>\n<li>As products get added, sellers should be familiar with Zalando imaging and content guidelines<\/li>\n<li>Prepare test orders that Zalando will use to check for quality assurance<\/li>\n<li>Mitigate the risk of fraud by completing Know Your Customer documents<\/li>\n<li>Download and review the most recently updated Zalando Platform Rules<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p>Zalando also offers marketing services to assist partners in selling on its marketplace. Before that, though, you need to make one of the most critical decisions of all: how you\u2019ll integrate your warehouse inventory with Zalando marketplace.<\/p>\n<h2>How marketplace integration services streamline selling on Zalando<\/h2>\n<p>Zalando offers what it calls a ZDirect User Interface, which brands can use to upload products to its marketplace.
