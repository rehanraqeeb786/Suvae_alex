The purpose of a supplemental data feed is to add missing data to your primary feed like a product\u2019s sale price in the location\u2019s native currency and language. Having both primary and supplemental feeds are highly beneficial for differentiating your products from your competitors.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><strong>Understand Country Groups in Google Merchant Center<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; margin-top: -18px;\">Google Merchant Center has created pre-determined country groups (Group A and Group B), which allow your product listings to appear to more customers outside of your core area. Depending on the primary country you have selected, your product listing will automatically appear in another country if both countries are within the same Country Group. This option gives you the advantage of marketing your products in more than just the initially selected country.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you have selected your primary country, you\u2019ve enabled your products to appear to your intended audience in a given area.<\/p>\n<p>By selecting a specific language, you\u2019ve also enabled your ads to appear to those who speak that language, whether they are in the selected country or not.<\/p>\n<p>These small updates to your feed can significantly improve the discoverability of your product listings.<\/p>\n<h2>How to opt-out products from Shopping ads in individual countries<\/h2>\n<p>You also have the freedom and ability to exclude some products from certain countries. Simply use the shopping_ads_excluded_country attribute when setting up your catalog through Google Merchant Center to pick and choose which countries you don\u2019t want your shopping ads to appear in.<\/p>\n<h3>Google Merchant Center: Common Errors for Multi-Country Feeds<\/h3>\n<p>To prevent product listing disapprovals, Google Merchant Center will automatically analyze your product data and notify you if any key issues or errors arise.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few of these common errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Missing ID in the feed catalog<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Currency and country mismatch<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Stock &amp; availability errors<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Shipping information &amp; tax information issues<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Errors with product images<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Errors with product descriptions<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Although these common errors can cause some setbacks, the great thing about Google Merchant Centre is that errors are flagged, and you will be notified automatically.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, by partnering with a sophisticated feed management solution, you\u2019ll have access to several benefits that make these common errors feel like a bump in the road.<\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of Using A Feed Management Platform for Google Shopping<\/h2>\n<p>Having your product feeds optimized for international markets through Google Merchant Center means that your customers in other countries will see your products listed in their native language and currency.<\/p>\n<p>By offering that kind of tailored shopping experience to your customers, you\u2019ve already got an advantage over your competition.<\/p>\n<p>A solution that includes <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/platform\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">feed management software<\/a><\/span> and a managed service to properly categorize your products based on the intended country and language helps you sell more products around the globe.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.19.5&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<h2>Facebook &amp; Instagram: Feeds for Multiple Countries &amp; Currencies<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/?attachment_id=9492\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9492 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Instagram-Facebook-Multicountry-Feed-1024x256.jpg\" alt=\"instagram-multicountry-feed\" width=\"1024\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Instagram-Facebook-Multicountry-Feed-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Instagram-Facebook-Multicountry-Feed-980x245.jpg 980w, https:\/\/highstreet.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Instagram-Facebook-Multicountry-Feed-480x120.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There are three different types of feeds you need to set up on Facebook and Instagram to successfully advertise and sell your products in international markets.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Catalog feed (which serves as the primary feed)<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Language feed<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Currency feed<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>With the help of a leading tech partner, like <a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Highstreet.io<\/span><\/a>, all three of these feeds can be consolidated into a single master feed, for optimal performance.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Steps to Set up Your Multi-Country and Multi-Language Feeds<\/h3>\n<p>As a merchant, there are two steps to successfully set -up your Multi-Country and Multi-Language feeds to maximize your performance on Facebook and Instagram:<\/p>\n<p><strong>STEP 1: Create a catalog feed for a default country and language<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When it comes time to develop accurate <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/highstreet.io\/instagram-product-feed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">product feeds for Instagram<\/a><\/span> and Facebook, you\u2019ll want to start by selecting your desired countries and languages.
