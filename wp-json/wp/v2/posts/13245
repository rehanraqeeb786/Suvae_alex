Even if you\u2019re not an experienced search engine marketer or eCommerce guru, running GMC promotions for your shopping ads is straightforward. All you need to know are the basics to get started.<\/p>\n<h3>Google Promotion Requirements<\/h3>\n<p>According to Google, there are three requirements for using their Merchant Promotions.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Products need to be redeemable at checkout or by the time of purchase<\/li>\n<li>The promotion needs to expire within 6 months of the date the promotion starts<\/li>\n<li>Promotions have to comply with Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/topic\/7322621\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promotions policies and editorial requirements<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Google Merchant Promotions are currently available in Australia, France, Germany, India, the UK, Canada, and the US.<\/p>\n<h3>Google Promotion Types<\/h3>\n<p>Before we get into how the set-up process works, it\u2019s important to know what types of promotions are available and their criteria.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discounts:\n<ul>\n<li>$ off or % off &#8211; Discounts must be at least $5 or 5% off<\/li>\n<li>x% off, maximum discount $y<\/li>\n<li>$x off $50+, $y off $100, or $z off $150 &#8211; Tiered discounts allowed<\/li>\n<li>x% to y% off &#8211; Floor discounts (like minimum amount or percent saved) must be stated<\/li>\n<li>Buy one get one free or buy one get 2nd x% off<\/li>\n<li>$x cash back or $x cash rebates &#8211; Must be reflected at the cart\u00a0 or checkout<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Shipping\n<ul>\n<li>Free or discounted shipping &#8211; Must have a valid redemption code.<\/li>\n<li>Exception: No redemption code is necessary when combined with another permissible promotion (for example free shipping + 10% off)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Free Gifts\n<ul>\n<li>Free item &#8211; Must clearly describe the gift and the item can&#8217;t be samples or trials<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">$x gift card on purchase &#8211; The title must clearly state the gift card value and the gift card must be from your own store<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Source &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/4588460?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Merchant Help<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Google Promotions set-up<\/h2>\n<p>To start your set-up, you must fill out the Google Merchant Promotions<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/contact\/promos_contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> interest form<\/a>.
