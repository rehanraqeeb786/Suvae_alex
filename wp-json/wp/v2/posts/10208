The platform requires a certain degree of technical capability where order management is concerned. And its help documentation isn&#8217;t always clear on what&#8217;s required for a seller.<\/p>\n<p>Getting approved to sell on the platform is a process in and of itself. You need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/learn\/lessons\/before-starting-with-commerce?course_id=508009376657017&amp;curriculum_id=789697481489855\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">submit comprehensive documentation to Facebook<\/a> on everything from your business details and your banking information to your customer service and return policies. Once you&#8217;re approved to sell, next comes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/learn\/lessons\/manage-orders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dealing with Facebook Shop Order Management.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive into the ways you can scale your Instagram and Facebook Shop order management processes.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Text&#8221; module_id=&#8221;when&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.18.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; link_font=&#8221;||||on||||&#8221; link_text_color=&#8221;#FCA163&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h2>Why You Need a Third-Party Facebook\/Instagram Shop Order Management Solution<\/h2>\n<p>For brands, the order management process is tedious and time-consuming. If you&#8217;re managing fewer than fifty orders a month only on Facebook, or plan to sell via only a single brand, you can probably deal with all of this manually.<br \/>Here\u2019s what the typical order management process looks like for individual and bulk orders:<\/p>\n<h3>Using Facebook Shop for Individual Orders<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>After being notified that a purchase has been made, open Facebook Commerce Manager, Select Orders, then Select &#8220;Waiting to be Shipped&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Once the order has been shipped, follow the same process again, and mark the order as shipped.<\/li>\n<li>If there is a single item or multiple items sent in a single shipment, check Mark All Items as Shipped. Otherwise, note the quantity of each item included in each shipment.<\/li>\n<li>Select the shipping carrier and provide tracking information for the order to Facebook.<\/li>\n<li>Provide the fulfillment location to Facebook so it can calculate sales tax.<\/li>\n<li>Select Review Shipment, and make sure all information is accurate.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Using Facebook Shop for Bulk Orders<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Select Manage Orders in Bulk from the Orders Tab.<\/li>\n<li>Select Export Orders.<\/li>\n<li>Choose a date range, select Orders that can be fulfilled, then Export File. This will download a CSV file of your orders.<\/li>\n<li>Open the CSV file.<\/li>\n<li>Fill out the information on quantity, shipping carrier, tracking numbers, and (optionally) location, then save the file.<\/li>\n<li>Import the edited CSV file back into Commerce Manager.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>As you might expect, the higher your sales volume, the more untenable your Facebook Shop order management becomes.<br \/>And the order management isn&#8217;t even the most time-consuming thing you&#8217;ll have to deal with, either. That honor goes to Facebook&#8217;s process for managing product returns, particularly when it comes to adjusting the taxes paid on a return.<\/p>\n<p>Scaling sales and growth requires automation to eliminate manual processes from your workflows, especially if you want to capitalize on growth opportunities through the dynamic Facebook and Instagram Shop channels. That\u2019s where the right order management platform comes into play.<\/p>\n<p>With effective automation, you can reduce the technical burden required to integrate Facebook Shop, automate tax adjustments for product returns, and scale growth across multiple brand pages &amp; shops \u2014 all in one location.<br \/>That\u2019s countless hours saved, fewer mistakes, and more efficient workflows.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Text&#8221; module_id=&#8221;integrated&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.22.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; link_font=&#8221;||||on||||&#8221; link_text_color=&#8221;#FCA163&#8243; header_4_text_color=&#8221;#142F5F&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h2>Move Fast With a Third-Party Facebook Shop Solution<\/h2>\n<p>Third-party Facebook Shop order management tools are fully supported by Facebook. Simply put, you can \u2014 and in many cases, should \u2014 work with an external vendor.<br \/>The benefit? It will <strong>significantly reduce your workload and make it much easier for your business (or businesses) to scale.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Once you are approved to sell on Facebook Shops, you can start working with the tool right away.

The answer depends on what channels you\u2019re using to sell your products.<\/p><p>In this post, we\u2019ll take a look at how to create a Facebook and Google international product feed strategy for new, global markets.<\/p><h2>Multi-Country and Multi-Language Feeds for Google Shopping<\/h2><h4>How to Set-up your Multi-Country and Multi-Language feeds:<\/h4><p>Let\u2019s start by looking at product feed requirements for certain countries in Google Merchant Center.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Create your primary feed, select your language and country.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">As a starting point, it\u2019s a good idea to see if your desired country appears on the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/160637#countrytable\">approved list<\/a> of countries for Google Shopping. Once a country and language have been selected, it\u2019s time to set the rules for your product data.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Setting up specific rules for your product data.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Feed rules are what help make your product feeds compliant and optimal for Google Merchant Center. Once you have selected your country and language, set your specific product feed rules to minimize errors.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Using supplemental feeds.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Supplemental feeds are additional sets of crucial product data that will help further differentiate your products by highlighting additional attributes. The purpose of a supplemental data feed is to add missing data to your primary feed like a product\u2019s sale price in the location\u2019s native currency and language. Having both primary and supplemental feeds are highly beneficial for differentiating your products from your competitors.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Understanding Country Groups in Google Merchant Center.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Google Merchant Center has created pre-determined country groups (Group A and Group B), which allow your product listings to appear to more customers outside of your core area. Depending on the primary country you have selected, your product listing will automatically appear in another country if both countries are within the same Country Group. This option gives you the advantage of marketing your products in more than just the initially selected country.<\/p><blockquote><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/merchants\/answer\/7448571?hl=en\">Country Groups within Google Merchant Center<\/a> and how they work.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Now that you have selected your primary country, you\u2019ve enabled your products to appear to your intended audience in a given area. By selecting a specific language, you\u2019ve also enabled your ads to appear to those who speak that language, whether they are in the selected country or not.<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">These small updates to your feed can significantly improve the discoverability of your product listings.<\/p><ul><li><strong>How to opt-out products from Shopping ads in individual countries.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">You also have the freedom and ability to exclude some products from certain countries. Simply use the shopping_ads_excluded_country attribute when setting up your catalog through Google Merchant Center to pick and choose which countries you don\u2019t want your shopping ads to appear in.<\/p><h4>Common Errors<\/h4><p>In order to prevent product listing disapprovals, Google Merchant Center will automatically analyze your product data and notify you if any key issues or errors arise. Here are a few of these common errors:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Missing ID in the feed catalog<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Currency and country mismatch<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Stock & availability errors<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Shipping information & tax information issues<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Errors with product images<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Errors with product descriptions<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Although these common errors can cause some setbacks, the great thing about Google Merchant Centre is that errors are flagged, and you will be notified automatically. On top of that, by partnering with a sophisticated feed management solution, you\u2019ll have access to a number of benefits that make these common errors feel like a bump in the road.<\/p><h4>The Benefits of Using A Feed Management Platform for Google Shopping<\/h4><p>Having your product feeds optimized for international markets through Google Merchant Center means that your customers in other countries will see your products listed in their native language and currency. By offering that kind of tailored shopping experience to<br \/>your customers, you\u2019ve already got an advantage over your competition.<\/p><p>A solution that includes <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/platform\/\">feed management software<\/a> and a managed service to properly categorize your products based on the intended country and language will help you sell more products around the globe.<\/p><h2>Facebook & Instagram Feeds for Multiple Countries & Currencies<\/h2><h4>Setting up your Multi-Country and Multi-Language feeds with Facebook and Instagram:<\/h4><p>With Facebook and Instagram, being able to successfully advertise and sell your products in international markets depends on three different types of feeds:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Catalog feed (which serves as the primary feed)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Language feed<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Currency feed<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><blockquote><p><strong>With the help of a leading tech partner, like <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/\">Suvae.org<\/a>, all three of these feeds can be consolidated into a single master feed, for optimal performance. <\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote><p>As a merchant, there are two steps to successfully set -up your Multi-Country and Multi-Language feeds to maximize your performance on Facebook and Instagram:<\/p><p><strong>STEP 1: Create a catalog feed for a default country and language<\/strong><\/p><p>When it comes time to develop accurate <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/instagram-product-feed\/\">product feeds for Instagram<\/a> and Facebook, you\u2019ll want to start by selecting your desired countries and languages. Start by creating a catalog for your default language and country. Then, you\u2019ll want to upload a data feed containing all of your product data to a catalog feed.<\/p><p><strong>Note:<\/strong> Your products must be present in all countries you've selected, but if this is not the case, the catalog file must be the one associated with the country with the highest number of products.<\/p><p>To help get you started, you can download a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/commerce_manager\/get_started\/\">country-specific feed template<\/a> from your Commerce Manage<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/commerce_manager\/get_started\/\">r<\/a> tab through your Facebook Business Help Center.<\/p><p><strong>STEP 2: Upload your data with the correct information and attributes<\/strong><\/p><p>Once you have your country and language feeds determined and selected, you\u2019ll need to upload these feeds to your catalog (primary) feed, while making sure that you\u2019re providing the correct information, such as:<\/p><ul><li>Country-specific pricing<\/li><li>Product descriptions<\/li><li>Language Code<\/li><li>Country Code<\/li><li>Stock availability<\/li><li>URLs by country (location)<\/li><\/ul><h4>Common Errors<\/h4><p>Below is a list of some common errors that can lead to product disapprovals on Facebook and Instagram. While many of these are similar to the common errors of Google Merchant Center, it\u2019s important to understand how to effectively resolve these errors in order to avoid any major setbacks.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Inaccurate pricing data<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>When implementing pricing data, be sure to include a 3-digit ISO 4217 currency code, such as EUR, rather than a currency symbol, such as \u20ac. If your price includes a decimal point, use a period (.) as the decimal, not a comma (,).<\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Here\u2019s a good example of the correct usage: <\/span><\/p><p><em>Correct: <\/em><\/p><p>5.99 EUR<\/p><p><em>Incorrect: <\/em><\/p><p>5,99 \u20ac<\/p><ul><li><strong>Missing ID in the feed catalog<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Entering a product that is not in the catalog feed will result in an error. If a product doesn't have a translation for a particular language, or if it\u2019s unavailable in a particular country, then it can be omitted from the language or country feeds respectively.<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Alternatively, if a product is missing in the Catalog feed, it means it can't be present anywhere else, and Facebook throws an error if you try to upload a translation for a product that is not present in the Catalog feed.<\/p><p>Some other common issues include:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Currency and country mismatch<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Shipping information & tax information issues<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Stock & availability errors<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>Luckily, with the help of a versatile feed management partner, these potential issues can be handled with ease, freeing up your time so that you can focus on what you do best: selling your products.<\/p><h4>The Benefits of Using A Feed Management Platform for Facebook<\/h4><p>Whether it\u2019s optimizing your feeds, categorizing your rich data into specific Country Groups, or resolving issues with inaccurate product data, a quality <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/\">shopping feed provider<\/a> will handle the time-consuming back-end headaches of developing and managing international Instagram and Facebook product feeds.<\/p><h2>How <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/\">Suvae.org<\/a> Can Help<\/h2><p>Our\u00a0platform and managed service not only helps to optimize your product feeds for marketing channels and marketplaces but also helps merchants create effective Multi-Country and Multi-Language <a href=\"https:\/\/Suvae.org\/ecommerce-product-feed-compliance-optimization\/\">feeds that are accurate and compliant<\/a>.<\/p><p>When clients submit their catalogs to the platform, it generates consolidated master feeds.
